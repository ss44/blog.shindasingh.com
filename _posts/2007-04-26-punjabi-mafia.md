If you've been following the news then you've undoubtedly heard about the Airport Taxi/Limo driver protest that happened in downtown city hall the other day. The matter at hand is city hall wanting to pass a bill banning limo drivers from picking up fares from the city, similar to how outside cab's can't grab fares from the airport.

Now all's good minus the fact that the media's jumped onto the whole matter, labeling the airport limo industry as being nothing more then an extension of the Punjabi Mafia, run from the heart of Malton. Which of course is surprising considering most airport/limo drivers are from Brampton, but lets not knit pick at the facts too much, after all they are just facts after all.

There's no denying that the Airport limo drivers are perceived as a strong lobby group in terms of political sway within the community. After all, if they weren't then politicians wouldn't go abouts seeking their blessings and making a sales pitch to them when elections came around. All the same, one needs to consider how much power any lobby group really has considering the various groups that exist within the community. After all if any group is to given Soprano like status you would have at least thought the various Gurdwara committee's (Looking at places like new Rexdale in particular) would have been the first to garnish such an accolade.

Anyway's I figured I'd share the media coverage on the topic considering that a good number of those involved in the whole fiasco are Singhs that we've all seen and or worked with at various times, and also in light to add to the whole media bias that seems to be rising up against the community, calling to arms that it's time that the community take its PR more seriosly, and take caution when dealing with sensative issues that will undoubtedly receive as much media coverage as they do.

Below are some excerpts from various media regarding the topic, the first is a blog entry by Mike Stafford, a radio personality in GTA who did a segment on his show, followed by a video clip from CTV news on the matter.

> I'm just about fed-up with the taxi and limousine industry in this city. If you listen to any advocate, and I don't, 95% of the drivers are PhD's whose credentials are waved away by employers because of racism. My guess is 95% of them (at least the downtown taxi drivers) are unemployable misanthropes who couldn't pass an official driving test if they bribed the instructor.
> 
> I watch these clowns every day and I lived in the city ten years without a car so I know the inside as well. The cars are a mess, the drivers spend the entire ride chatting on a cell phone and some of them are clearly "on" something.
> 
> But it's the airport limo mafia that makes me puke. A largely Punjabi phenomenon, these pirates routinely and illegally steal rides from the downtown clowns. Politically influential (I'm looking at YOU Harinder Takar) they run the GTAA limo stand like Tony Soprano. They treat passengers like garbage and today they made a mockery of the political process at City Hall.
> 
> Enraged that Toronto would cut them off from downtown hotel pickups, the limo louses started a mini-riot that had Council speaker Sandra Bussin almost at wits end (memo to Sandra: maybe the speaker's job isn't for you). 
> 
> The audio and video sounded and looked like a fight in a foreign parliament. Completely ridiculous. And they got their way...even though there were a couple of arrests and trespassing tickets, the buggers had the issue put off until later.
> 
> Enough already. Build a fixed link to Pearson and put these bullies out of business.
