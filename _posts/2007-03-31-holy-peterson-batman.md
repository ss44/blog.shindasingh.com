Raps vs the Wizards March 30th, by far the greatest game this season. Ah still coming off cloud 9, but what can I say about Peterson other then 3 pts in 9 seconds and he made it when it counted. Bosh a good night as always, 37 pts 14 rebounds, and Bosh nailing the coffin in the casket with that dirty block in the dying seconds of OT.

Onions baby onions...3rd in the East with a Rookie team, hoepfully we don't turn into the Supersonics.
