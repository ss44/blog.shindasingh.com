Its time for another one of those illustrious Mann Sion updates. A while back he was in NY and [everyone reported](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=146 "Boycott of Pehova Wale") about the boycott that took place. Everyone celebrated that finally the world is taking notice about his deeds and rejoicing, that finally he is starting to pay for them.

However, in similar fashion the Mann Sion supporters where also out in full force celebrating their victory showing the number of individuals who came out to Mann Sion's divans and again challenged the world to get away from behind the screens and come do something, if they had a certain type of fortitude that is.

Now maybe its just me, but it seems that ["do something",](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=146#comment-770) has become the battle cry of his supporters. When Sanjh Savera first broke the news, they all cried that if it's true then people should "do something". So Sangat reacted and started handling things in a diplomatic fashion.. They got sworn affidavits, got victims to come forward to share there stories, and literally started taking action 'away from the keyboard', as the Mann Sion supporters all begged. But this again wasn't enough, "do something more" they chanted. So Gurdwara's from around the world started to boycott Mann Sion. He was banned from various stages, in India, Canada, and the States. "Do something" they echoed again, do what the Sangat asked? Confront him, they said. So this last week Singhs gathered at San Fransisco International Airport to do just that. And what pray-tell do Mann Sion and his cast of jolly men do in result? Call the cops, and exit through the back. Vah veee vaah Singhoo...RUN??? Since when has running been something Sikhs do, let alone something that "Sants" do? I guess the lack of that fortitude is now prevalent on another side.

How far do _you_ really want or need this to escalate? Come on now, give it up already and I post this as a challenge to you. DO SOMETHING. Ask your Baba to come to Canada, where he can be charged and brought to a court of justice, and face the allegations against him in a public court. Don't believe in the secular courts or the Canadian justice system, then lets take things to the supreme court of the Sikhs. Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib and invite the major leaders from all major jathebanid's **world** wide, (inviting Badal's stooge's over and over again to handle things seems pointless) and get them to act as impartial judges to hear things out.

But lets face it, the most we can expect from y'all are the relentless comments on these blogs and forums telling everyone else to "do something", but then again what more can or should one really expect?
