Its actually the store that our very own 7 ft Baba, AKA Giani Bhai Parminder Singh used to spend his summers working at. Most the stores are in pretty impoverished neighborhoods but Redwood is in one of the worst.

Anyways there was a stabbing at the store yesterday, you can see the [article here](http://www.wcpo.com/news/2006/local/03/22/stab.html), but in case it disappears, I thought I'd immortalize the story here. (Look hard enough and you can Basis car in that pic)
