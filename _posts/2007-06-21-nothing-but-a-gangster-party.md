It took a minute, but I finally found the CBC Documentary from a few years back on the Indo Canadian Gang problem. I remember when the CBC first aired this special, it was the talk of the town, with some pissed that the CBC worked so hard to showcase the dark side of the community while others took it as a wake up call.

I think the thing people need to remember is most of this violence is largely drug related, not saying that it makes it right, but once you get into the drug game getting killed is just part of the game, so if you don't want to get killed just don't do drugs.

Although Toronto's drug scene isn't near as notable as that of the west coasts, it's only a matter of time before we catch the media's attention here, especially seeing as how Brampton has been dubbed the central hub for majority of drug imports/exports on this side of Canada.  It's not a proven fact, but it is the word on the block, with most of the jails filled with Punjabis caught trying to smuggle in drugs from the South) but the majority of the crimes seems to be the trafficking and smuggling of the packgaes rather then the local distribution of it (where most gang  land violence seems to stem from).

Then again without any solid figures and stats, the above amounts to being nothing more then speculation and hearsay, but then again all those Hummers rollingg around Brampton may speak a different story.
