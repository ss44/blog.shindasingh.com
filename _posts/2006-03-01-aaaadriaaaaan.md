I was planning on leaving early this morning for the store and school, but while eating breakfast and flipping through the channels to find my dose of morning sports highlights from last night, I came across Rocky 5 playing on A & E, so couldnt help, but to sit back and watch.

[<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Rocky-782732.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Rocky-791695.jpg)Growing up, the Rocky movies were always a favourite. (So were the Rambos and Terminators). I think Rocky was one of those movies that all desis loved. I still remember sitting around with my dad and uncles watching Rocky, and I knew half of them couldnt understand a word that was being said, but they still loved watching the man fight, and wouldnt hesitate to add to their own custom soundtrack with Hii, Ohhh, Oh Dekh, Oh Mariya, Dekhiiiiii.

Anyways I remember hearing a year ago, about rumours of a Rocky 6, with Rockys son or him coming back. So I [googled](http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=Rocky+6&btnG=Google+Search&meta=) it and truth be told production on Rocky 6 just got started a little while ago. (I also managed to find [the script and screen play to it](http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=6783)).

Now Rocky 5 was crucified by the critics as an un-necessary sequel, although I didnt think it was all that bad. So I wonder if Rocky 6 will be any good (after all its been 30 years since the original Rocky) , or will it end up being a desperate attempt by Stallone to rake in some money and revive his acting career.

I guess we have to wait until 2007 before we find out, lets just hope he doesnt mess this up, but until then I cant help but look forward to it.
