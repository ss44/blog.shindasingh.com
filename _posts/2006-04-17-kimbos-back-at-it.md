Being that its exam time, and the fact that I'm actually trying to study this time around, you may have noticed me ease away from the blogging, just a tad bit. However knowing that many of you come here to pass time when you're bored, or taking a study break I thought I'd add the latest Kimbo video I came across.

For those who dont know, Kimbo's a street fighter from Miami, and I posted some of his videos here before. (The earlier ones can be found [here](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=30) & [here](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=38)), who has earned quite the reputation largely due to his fights being posted up all over the internet.



I have no idea what the other fighter was thinking, trying to step up against Kimbo, and it was clear from the start he had no intention of even putting up a fight (whole time he's backing off), but then again I can't really blame him, but then again why step into the ring if you don't plan on knocking the mans out?

Fights not all that, actually its pretty much a waste of time considering Kimbo dealt the guy in one punch, but then again you came here looking to pass some time, so hopefully that video did it for you. I think Kimbo needs to step into a real ring and face off against some real competitors, more fights with people like Gannon really do help put things into perspective.
