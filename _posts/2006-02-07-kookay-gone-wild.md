I'll be honest, I'm not a big fan of Naamdhari's, never have been, was somewhat cool with them for a minute (the Jagardhang Naghardhang track), but then I snapped back to reality.

Now before you think I'm getting all racist or prejudiced or whatever else, you got to realize that Naamdhari's for all I know maybe really good people, but for their beliefs I can not ever openly accept them.

Sure they do Raag, yes they even lay emphasis on Raag, and good for them! Too bad they also believe in a daydhari Guru. It's an insult and a slap to Guru Gobind Singh, every minute when they tell us that their Guru is Guru Gobind Singh Ji's successor.

Some sites now accept Kookay as being a _branch of_ Sikhs. They are not Sikhs! They might be good people, but not Sikhs. They never will be, until the day they recognize only Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, as the true and immortal Guru, until the day they kneel before Guru Roop, Punj Pyarai they will remain separated and on their own path, astray from the Guru Panth.

I don't know why I'm so frustrated with Kookay. I think largely because they're spreading there mythology even further and further. Akaal Takhat has rejected Naamdharis from the panth, yet mainstream Sikhs still openly accept them into their homes.

I honestly don't understand where they're coming from. How do people believe them? Why do people believe them? If any good is to be derived from them, then it would have to be that they help take the fools out of Sikhi, leaving us with those who have at least the common sense to know that the Naamdhari panth is not a genuine panth, it's a leach, sucking the blood out of Sikhi, which is even more frustrating since we're already filled with our own set[<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sellout-790596.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sellout-798243.jpg) of Pimp's (Babbay, Jatehdars, Granthis, Gianis Mahants), who are busy pimping our Panth for their own glorification and satisfaction. But then again, in the olden days they used leaches to help cure sicknesses, by sucking out the diseases and poisons, so maybe there could be some good to all this?

Only Guru Sahib knows, but until then let's just sit back and enjoy watching Kookay going wild.
