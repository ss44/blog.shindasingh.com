This entire sports season I have not cared much for the NHL but the playoffs always get everybody excited. However, even the playoffs weren't doing it for me this year until I was talked into joining my annual NHL Playoff pool.Â  And boom, I got excited after looking at the match-ups, etc. So in the spirit of that, I bring you my annual NHL Playoff picks.

This year I'm going to do it round by round and award points to everybody that gets their picks right. The winner at the end will be given a cash prize. How big of a cash prize? I'll have to check with my inner Grewal, I mean my accountant.

The scoring system is as follows:

**1 point** for picking the winner of each series.

**1 point** for for picking the correct number of games.

Now that the rules are set, let me bust out my picks.

**Western Conference
  
** 
  
Winners in bold.

**1 - San Jose** vs. 8 - Anaheim | 4 - 1

**2 - Detroit** vs. 7 - Columbus | 4-1

**3 - Vancouver** vs. 6 - St Louis | 4-2

**4 - Chicago** vs. 5 - Calgary | 4-3

**Eastern Conference**

**1 - Boston** vs. 8 - Montreal | 4-2

**2 - Washington** vs. 7 - NY Rangers | 4-2

**3 - New Jersey** vs. 6 - Carolina | 4-3

**4 - Pittsburgh** vs. 5 - Philadelphia | 4-2

My pics are set, make sure you post yours if you want in on the prize. And since I posted this about 3 hours before the playoffs start, I will give until Thursday 5:00pm to let everyone get their picks in. Also, please keep the same name throughout, it makes shit easier.
