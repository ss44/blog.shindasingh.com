In light of the fact that Sikh film festivals are the new fad right now (theres the [Spinning Wheel Film Festival](http://www.spinningwheelfestival.com/), and also [SikhNet's Film Festival](http://www.sikhnet.com/s/FilmFestival)) I find it only appropriate to bring some original films here, and have a mini film festival here. I guess the target would be to feature a new short film every two weeks, but I'd be able to sustain that for very long, considering I don't have a camcorder and am not about to go buy one (unless of course y'all want to pitch in).

On that note I present to you a video created by the Ottawa Gaffer AKA Sukhdeep Singh, for his final school project. The premise for this video is every students nightmare sleeping in for an exam. The film follows Jasdeep Singh (the late Student) as he wakes up late and overcomes all foreseeable obstacles that get in his way in his attempt to get to school to write his exam.

Sukhdeep Singh did an excellent job in highlighting not only Jasdeep Singhs moral dilemma but also his spiritual one. By starting the movie off it is more then apparent that Jasdeep has missed Amrit Vela, is a manmukh in many ways and Sukh shows this by giving Jasdeep Singh a patit saroop. However upon completion of Nitnem Jasdeep magically transforms back into his Khalsa roop. (naw, I'm just shitting you, the first actor quit on him).

Anyways without further ado the video of the moment:
