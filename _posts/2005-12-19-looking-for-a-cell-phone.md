The last cell phone I had, Siemens C65, was a decent phone, but sadly enough is no longer with us. (Actually it is, but its barley hanging on to life, since sports last Friday).

So now I'm on the hunt for a new phone. Considering I'm with Fido I've already got a limited selection of phones that are actually worth getting.

What swayed me to get the Siemens last time, was the fact that it only cost $25, and thats without getting a Fido service plan. This time around, theres not much choice when it comes to phones less then $30, without getting a plan first. (Chepeast I saw on fido so far goes for $50, and thats only with a new account). So it looks like I'mma have to subscribe to a plan this time around (I've been on a monthly term things for now).

The fido service hasn't been as bad to me as it has for others, I credit that to the phone, considering others such as Jasdev and his $800 Sony phone had issues with reception from my house, back in Brampton. Although Imma be using the phone more here in Ottawa, I still want something I can use when I go back home in the summer.

So on to the choices. So Ive kind of narrowed down my search to these two phones.

The fist is the Sony Ericsson Z520a. Now the phone looks good and I'm willing to dish out the[<img width="71" height="139" border="0" align="left" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/erics_z520a-719859.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/erics_z520a-721789.jpg) $75 for the phone, but what concerns me is, is it worth it? Sure the phones feature packed, has everything I need and more. Actually, anyone who knows me knows that it has more then what I really need, but thats beyond the point. Phone has good reviews, but so far all reviews I read about it talk about it looking good, being entertaining and just being stylish. Nothing I've read talks about whether or not it actually works, or what the reception is like, the most important category for me right now, and the one thing keeping me away from just grabbing this phone. (Why get a phone that doesn't work?)

The second one I'm looking at is, the LG 2000. Now this phone just got shitty ratings overall. [<img width="68" height="132" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/lg_2000-730760.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/lg_2000-732878.jpg)Everyone on the few forums I checked out just talks about how crap the phone is, when it comes to customization, ease of use and support, but then again its only $30 with the contract, so can't be that bad. I really dont got much to say on this one. Looks good, has features, but from the reviews these features are just not implemented properlly.
  
Also lacks a lot of the features of the previous.

And the other options, I dont got none. All the other phones on the site cost to much, or are on the verge of ending up on the discontinued list, but if you see something that you think I should grab from the [fido site](http://www.fido.ca/portal/product/product.do) then let me know your picks.

Chulloo the Raptor game started getting good, so time to watch that. For all yall in Toronto recognize and realize, that I'll be back Wednesday.
