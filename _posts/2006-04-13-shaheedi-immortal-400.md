Firstly, sareea'n Sangtaaan noo lukh lukh Vasakhi deea'n vadhayiaa'n. Hopefully every one had/is going to have a good day.

In the recent years, (well last 4) the launch of [Shaheedi Immortality](http://www.shaheedi.com) CDs has become synonymous with Vasakhi, and something that I actually look forward to listening to.

I remember when the first CD dropped four years ago, everyone was into them. The mixes werent all that wonderful, but the concept was up there. Although the first CD left me grinning at the idea, the mixes grew annoying fast. Anyone who heard the first CD knows what Im talking about. The instrumentals used were overplayed and had been remixed to death, so mixing them with Khavis didnt really do the Khavta all that much justice. You also cant overlook the fact that more often then not the Khavta and beat didnt even mix properly. Its like taking two things that sound good on there own, and then trying to force them together which doesnt necessarily create a good end product.

None the less the seeds were laid, and the next two CDs where phenomenal. The Khavtas and beats complimented each other, the Khavtas themselves were amazing, with Jagowale becoming a house hold name in youth circles who would have otherwise never cared to listen to Khavis before. All of a sudden it was cool again, it was relevant and people cared.

It was with that legacy of topping each CD prior that had me more anxious then ever to cop the latest CD, and I was pretty weary that maybe the bar had been set to high and I was expecting maybe to much, fortunately the crew in charge of compiling and making the disk, didnt disappoint.

Theres no doubt that that the topic of Shaheedi and Kurbani is a touching one, which moves even the hardest of Singhs. Even though many scoff at the idea that these heart wrenching Khavtas are mixed with rap or even club instrumentals I think many of them will be surprised with the new release, while those who listen for beats may be disappointed.

The first track, Mukhon Satnaam Bolda, is a welcome change from the usual. Most of those who Ive talked to about the CD thought the track was weak, but if you listen to the actual track and pay attention to what Khavi is talking about then you can only sit in awe as they describe Bhai Mati Das Jis Shaheedi and feel inspired by the love they held for Sri Guru Tegh Bahdaur Sahib Jee when they where sawn in half wishing only that there head fall to the feet of Guru Sahib. The way Tigerstyle mixed the track only helped to improve the emotion.

  Most people Ive talked with thought the second track was up their, but I was pretty disappointed. This was a classic Jagowale hip hop remix, but the remix felt as stale as bread passed its expiry date. Like I said two good things being mashed together doesnt guarantee a positive outcome. Maybe this had to do with the Khavta not being brand new, or maybe it just the sound quality, but it just didnt gel, and if I was trump and this track was applying to be an apprentice, then it would have been fired.

  The third track, Panjab Da Ghumaan, was again brilliant, and again like the first track no heavy instrumental was banging away, it was simply lyrical. As the title suggests this one was all about Punjab and the problems facing the once glorious province. From pakhandhi babay throwing on white dastaars and making a quick dollar, to the fall of the proud Damdami Taksal under Dhumma.. This track covered it all nashay, police, everything. Cant wait to go home and play this for my cousins, and relatives, right before they get mashed, and get all Jatt Tipsy on me.

Tracks 4, 6 and 7, Reet Khalsa Di, Legend of Sukha and Jinda, and The Creator were all nice mixes, but didnt do much for me, and nothing really stood out or inspired. The beats and Khavtas all flowed awesome, but nothing really stood out about these, they, just werent lyrical enough. Legend of Sukha and Jinda, was to much like a dance song and that really took away from the khavta. Even though all these mixed and it all worked mix and sound wise, they just didnt work out in the end because they either lost the message or the message just wasnt there.

  Chamakde Taare, another slow track that worked for me. This one was dedicated to Mata Gujri The guitar instrumental really complimented the track and it was one of those zone out chill out tracks, and you got to love it the way they fused the Sirangi and the traditional Khavi style with this.

The lyrics painted the picture, told the story and just took you back in time, with the beat doing exactly what its supposed to do, compliment the lyrics. Probably one of the finest mix of lyrics and instrumentals on the entire CD. Jagowale really picked up the slack with this one as did the Immortal Productions crew.

The closing track was dedicated to Sahib Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji, and their Kurbani. The lyrics were nice, but again they didnt really take me back or paint any clear picture, and just didnt take you there emotionally.

Anyways overall the CD is worth supporting, after all, all funds go back into various community sevas and youth initiatives, so its well worth the mere few dollars or pounds the Sevadaars are asking for it. Although many Singhs may not appreciate the entire concept or even the CD itself, I really think those coming new or coming into Sikhi will enjoy, and learn something with this, so grab a CD if not for you, get it for a younger cousin, friend whoever.
