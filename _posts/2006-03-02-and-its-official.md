Its only a matter of hours now before the verdict from the Supreme Court regarding the Kirpan is announced.

I think as a community as a whole we have yet to grasp the far reaching implications that this verdict holds on our community. A positive verdict, allows us the freedom to practice Sikhi without worrying about the Kirpan issue again. Sure challenges will arise, but the Supreme Courts decision will only but help to set the precedent for all future cases, in which case the minor courts would more then need to accept the Supreme Courts ruling.

A negative verdict however would offer the opposite. It would set the wrong precedent, and make challenges for the Kirpan, just that, challenges. Future legislation such as allowing the Kirpan on trains and busses will be that much harder to fight. Schools and school boards would be free to discriminate against Sikhs who choose to wear the Kirpan and basically have the power to decide whether or not they allow them.

Now I dont see this being that big of a problem in places like Brampton, Rexdale, Mississauga, but thats not to say that things cant change. The battle will be especially tough in places such as Ottawa, Quebec, and places in rural Canada where the Kirpan has raised many eyebrows and not all for the better.

In a worst case scenario there would only be a few options left for us to exercise. The main being to get legislation and amendments made to existing laws, by means of lobbying our politicians. [I wrote before](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2006/01/less-then-72-hours.html) about how a Conservative government may not be the ideal candidate to help us with this, but then again they did help us with the Turban case back in the early 90s so you never know.

My prediction on the verdict that Im sure is shared with a few others is that the Supreme Court will allow the wearing of the Kirpan as justifiable by _The Rights to Religious Freedom,_ however restrictions such as those placed by the Quebec court will be put in place. The conditions in that ruling, were such things as The Kirpan need be sowed and wrapped in cloth, at all times.

I guess that all depends on how well the lawyers who argued this case, fought. If they made the Kirpan into nothing more then a symbol, then such restrictions wouldnt hurt or affect the Kirpans value. However, if the opposite was argued such that the Kirpan is more then mere symbolism and that it acts as a tool for a Sikh, then off course that gives the judges more food for thought.

So as we sit back and wait for the ruling we can only hope things go our way, but we still cant let optimism cloud reality. That being, Canadians and Canada may just not be ready.

_Note: By the time I finished writing this the Court had ruled, and it_ ruled in **favor of the Sikhs and the Kirpan!!**
