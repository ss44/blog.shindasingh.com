    According to the Urban Dictionary, the term ‘flop’ is defined as:
  </p>
  
  <p class="MsoNormal">
    <p class="MsoNormal">
      A word used to describe someone who falls over on purpose in sport to get a foul.
    </p>

        (That’s not the only definition, but you really don’t want to know the others.)

          Majority of people have heard the term flop or flopper used in the course of a NBA game and majority of the time it’s usually a defensive player who flops but the game has it’s share of Offensive Floppers as well.

            The term Offensive Flop is used to describe those who flop on the offensive end to draw calls from referees so that they can get a foul and/or get to the foul line. Now to some extent every single NBA player is an offensive player because they all do a little something extra to draw the attention of the referees whether it’s throwing their arms up or screaming out loud, also known as the verbal flop.

              However, I’m only going to mention those players who do it consistently and may even have a go to offensive flop move. Yes that’s right, a go to offensive flop move.

                There are two players that come to the top of my mind when I heard the term offensive flopper and they are Emanuel Ginobli (GINOBLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII) and Paul “That’s why they call him the Truth” Pierce. The Ginobli one is rather easy as most of us remember his hair flopping all over the place. Every time he drove and felt the air of someone close to his face he would flail his head around and his hair would do a tail spin and the referees would think he had just been molested by Mike Tyson and blow the whistle.

                  Now onto the man whose face got fucked up back in the day, Paul Pierce. First off, I don’t like him. For some reason and I really don’t know why, I just don’t like PP. Maybe it’s because he plays for the Celtics but whatever the reason, I don’t like the man and his head swinging flopping ways. If you watch him play, you’ll notice when he drives and he even thinks someone is about to come close to him or touch him, he’ll raise his head like someone gave him an uppercut and the sad thing is, it works so much of the damn time. The referees fall for that bullshit. Sometimes I hope somebody stabs his face again just so that he would stop doing that stupid, stupid head fake. Fuck Paul Pierce and Fuck the Celtics.

                        Now obviously there are many more in this league but those are the ones that continue to stand out in my eyes. And as for the defensive floppers, I’ll get to them one day.
