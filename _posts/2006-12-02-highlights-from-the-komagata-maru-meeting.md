Last week there was a meeting held by the Government of Canada, at Pearson convention center to get the community's input on what they wanted&nbsp;to see from the Government&nbsp;in an effort&nbsp;make amends for the [Komagata Maru incident of 1914](http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/BC/komagata_maru_incident.htm). 

Incidentally enough the&nbsp;community came out in all its diverseness to put forth its views for the respected camps they represented. Having found and read the following posts [[1](http://www.hennasingh.com/2006/11/meeting.html), [2](http://www.hennasingh.com/2006/11/old-speakers.html), [3](http://www.hennasingh.com/2006/11/young-speakers.html), [4](http://www.hennasingh.com/2006/11/and-good.html)] on the whole thing I only felt it fare to toss my 10 cents into the mix and share some notable suggestions from the day, or at least those few that I can still remember.&nbsp; (Note:- None of these are direct quotes, rather me paraphrasing to the best of my memory. Notably some names have been replaced, due to lack of memory of who actually said what, also other names have been replaced with groups who I felt pretty much said the same thing.)

> Don't insult the Sikhs, by referring to the incident as an Indo-Canadian tragedy. Majority of those involved in the tragedy were themselves Sikhs and seeing as how the Government and [constitution of India](http://lawmin.nic.in/coi.htm)&nbsp;[article. 25], fails to recognize and continues to deny Sikhs&nbsp;[their rights](http://www.sikhcoalition.org/Sikhism21.asp),&nbsp;don't ad insult to injury by&nbsp;lumping Sikhs and Indians together in the same boat.

> Prime Minister, Stephen Harper is God incarnate.&nbsp;May all praise be upon&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Harper for doing what is not only morally right but&nbsp;for taking a firm&nbsp;stand for&nbsp;the protection of human rights. May God shower Stephen Harper with a long and prosperous life, and may the&nbsp;Conservative party continue to lead Canadians on the moral and just path.&nbsp;

> If the&nbsp;government is truly sorry for the incidents of the Komagata Maru, and is serious about making amends, then it needs to also reflect and focus upon the policies that led up to the event just as much as it does on the actual event itself. We are seeing similar preferential, racial treatment today being reflected not only in Canada's immigration laws and policies, but also in the judicial,&nbsp;and government offices appointments that mirror the racial and prejudicial policies and attitudes that existed in 1914.&nbsp;Apologize for yesterdays mistakes by not&nbsp;continually repeating those same mistakes today.&nbsp;  
> **- Sikhs For Social Justice and few other Sikh youth speakers, including** [**COSS**](http://www.sikhstudents.ca/)**.**

> Focus on grass roots education in history classes, by giving the incident more then just an aside note in history books and making the Komagata Maru incident an essential part in the study of Canadian History. Reflect upon the Sikhs contribution to Canadian society and help to uncover the history, role and acknowledgement of the Sikhs throughout Canada's formation. (I.e [Details in regards to Sir John A McDonald's recognition of the Sikh martial tradition.](http://www.sikhsangat.com/index.php?showtopic=22812))  
> **- Sandeep Singh Brar [**[**Sikhs.org**](http://www.sikhs.org)**], COSS, and many others**

> Stop discriminating against us now. Give our elders old age pension.  
> **- Various Sikh elders.**

Other suggestions that were reflected by many included such things as:

  * A formal and written apology by the Government, in the house of commons 
      * Memorial erected at Stanley Park to commemerate and educate&nbsp;about the tragedy. 
          * Create a [heritage commercial](http://www.histori.ca/minutes/theme.do?id=10006&className=ca.histori.minutes.entity.ClassicMinute), on the incident.&nbsp; [Click a segments on the right to play] 
              * Make parliamentarians watch the [documentary](http://www.socialdoc.net/kazimi/ali_html_pages2/1AK2Cont.html), (A&nbsp;Continuous Journey),&nbsp;on the Komagata Maru in the House of Commons 
                  * Play the [documentary](http://www.socialdoc.net/kazimi/ali_html_pages2/1AK2Cont.html) of the Komagata Maru on CBC (National Television) 
                      * Make an effort to honour the families of those aboard the Komagata Maru, and offer the&nbsp;kin of those rejected a chance to settle and immigrate to&nbsp; Canada.</ul> 
                    There were other points also discussed but the above was most of what stood out to me and that I was able to take back. There were various other speakers who also spoke, but I feel the above sums up the majority of what was spoken. Now that the ball is back in the Governments hands, lets see what they do, considering they want to get this done before April so that it doesn't end up getting swallowed and forgotten about in another election.
