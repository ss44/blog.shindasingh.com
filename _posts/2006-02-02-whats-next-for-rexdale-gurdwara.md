For those of you who didnt know, Rexdale Gurdwara, (on Highway 27 where Yudh was held last year), for the past while was [involved in a legal struggle](http://www.rexdalesinghsabha.com/). Basically to spare the irrelevant details there are two committees A & [committee B](http://www.rexdalesinghsabha.com/). Committee A is the _bad guy in all this_, and basically started to rob the golak causing the Sangat to create committee B. [The whole court thing happened](http://www.sanjhsavera.com/jan_2806.html) and its only a matter of time now before committee A is officially removed and the Gurdwara handed back to committee B, the Sangat. Right now everyones just waiting for the legalities to get sorted out, but judgment was awarded to committee B last week.

Now as I stated earlier Committee B is the Sangat. So this leads to what Im really after, what will the Sangat decide to do with the Gurdwara now? The reason I even bring this up, is because there is already another Gurdwara 5 minutes away (old Rexdale), and the location of the Gurdwara in question is not all that desirable (its next to a strip joint), and people have been complaining about that for a while now.

_Soooo, what will come of the Gurdwara when the old committee finally receives the boot?_

If the Sangat decides to keep the Gurdwara, as a Gurdwara then I guess life will pretty much go on as normal. However I could also see the property and land being sold, and the money put back into the community, and I dont really object to that.

It would be a convenient facility to have around for events such as Yudh, and even a good place and way to start other youth initiatives such as sports leagues (i.e. a Basketball leagues for youth etc.)

Its been a long time coming that the Sikh community get itself such a facility, especially at the rate that its been growing, so its about time we get something like a rec-center that is sponsored by the OGC or Sangat in general.

But then again thats just my 10 cents. Im sure everyone else has their own ideas.
