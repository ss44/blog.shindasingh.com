It seems as though in recent weeks there's been a lot of news coverage on the accommodation of minorities who come to this country, and when is enough, enough. From the allegations of Peel Memorial Hospital discriminating against hiring nurses who can't speak Punjabi, the controversy at Pearson with Muslims wanting to install foot washing basins. even onto the political stage with the platform of John Tory and his PC party to support and fund faith based schools [attended by only 2% of Ontario's ethnic minorties], at the end of the day the news is everywhere and it seems as though it has everyone talking.

I figure a good portion of this coverage and dialogue could be be accredited to Bruce Allen, even though his comments didn't really come to my attention until this morning; despite having been posted in the comments. None the less, it seems that what Allen had to say really woke quite a few people up and really got everyones attention, including C.O.S.S's. For the most part I have to commend COSS and more specifically Supreet Singh for taking a decisive stand and getting things done. I also have to commend Singh for going on public radio and for the most part being able to hold his own against an audience and host that were pitted against him.

All the same, the discussion isn't a new one and the arguments don't seem to ever change. On one hand you have those who feel that everything they stand and believe in is being taken away from them, while on the other you have those who just want an equal playing field so they to can get a piece of the same pie that everyone else has been enjoying for the last so many decades.

Most who came here, came with the same goals and hopes. A fresh new start, a do over. For some Canada was everything they dreamt for, a country where they could take refuge under the charter and its laws. It's this very bond that individuals have with the charter and the freedom's that it allows, which creates and breeds most of the animosity that exists between groups on both sides of the argument; those who feel we're not doing enough and those who feel we've done to much.

For those who lack rights the charter has been the defining corner stone which in due time ensures that their own rights are granted and protected. For those who have rights it's the constant fear that with the ever evolving and encompassing nature of Canada's charter, that the Canada that _"they"_ have come to know and love will one day be taken away from them,

You'd be hard pressed to blame either side for feeling the way that it does, since it's only a matter of time before yesterdays minority becomes tomorrows majority who in turn goes on to oppress against next weeks up 'n coming oppressed group. But amongst all that irony what remains the most ironic is that for a country who's entire identity and culture is based around its ability to accept all as being equal; it remains in constant struggle to do so.

Anyways getting back to Allen's comments. I've listened to them a few times now. I've also been able to listen to his justification of his comments. A little, too late? Maybe. Succumbing to pressure amidst the growing public furor to make amends with his advertisers? Possibly. But regardless of how you interrupt what Allen said, he did bring the reality of the constant struggle that minorities face once again to the forefront of public discussion and its the hypocrisy highlighted through such discussions that forces the majority to at some point take a look in the mirror and realize what they're doing and help ignite a flame amongst the minorities to remind them, that they still have a long way to go.

After all as [Tejdeep Singh more eloquently writes](http://tejdeepsingh.wordpress.com), its the constant pushing and challenging of the status-quo which continues to drive us forward setting the on going precedent while leading by example.
