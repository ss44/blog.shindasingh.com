Looks like Colbert is right once again, and I guess this blog only echo's what he 's saying, but eh I still think posting and linking stuff does more then most hunger strikes off yesterday ever did. But then again I'm also part of the minority that think this kid had it coming, and don't see him getting all barbecued as being that big of a deal. (A sad day when the only person who agrees with you is Fox News).

But in all seriousness, although the force may have been a bit excessive, there was a reason no one jumped to his defence, and it wasn't fear or not knowing what was happening. It was because people couldn't stand him. If you watch the videos where he's being escorted out, you can hear the applause from the audience once the police grab him. For those who think they were cheering at his comments, watch the video again and pay closer attention. Most people let out a sigh the second he started patronizing Kerry, and were relieved when someone came and finally shut him up.

My apathy towards the man has little to do with his opinion or his message. It's not that I don't think he has a right to say what he had to say, or that I'm against anything he was saying. It was the way he was saying it which hit a nerve, avoiding the point with his long winded "build up". At least if he had gotten to the point we'd have all heard Kerry reply. But instead we hear this Nancy boy screaming at the top of his lungs because the police were there wanting to escort him out for having caused a disturbance prior to having even gone before the mic.

Then again at least he helped give me something to post about, so digg, link and post it.
