You ever notice that englandi's say 'loo" when referring to the crapper?&nbsp;By similar virtue wouldn't Waterloo thus imply , a crapper filled with water? Seeing as how Canada was and is under British Raaj, what dignified general, or Lord, came up with the idea of calling Waterloo, Waterloo?

With that in mind why do folk at Waterloo take such pride in going/being there? Would&nbsp;this also&nbsp;explain the deep fried stench that resonates throughout the hall of its illustrious university?

Remember, friends don't let friends go to Waterloo..
