Somehow or another I ended up on [this blog](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/002140.html), where they had a thing on Jasmine Singh, a NJ based, 17 year-old Sikh hacker, and I thought to myself, about time!

Although sources are sketchy on what exactly happened, I found [this link](http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/112-05142005-489320.html) where his crime was apparently,

> According to investigators and court papers, Singh was hired over the Internet by 18-year-old Jason Arabo of Southfield, Mich., to conduct the DOS attacks against Delran-based Jersey-Joe.com and other online companies that sell retro sports apparel in competition with his own online businesses, www.customleader.com

So, Jasmine made a mistake or two, no reason to hate on him, instead lets give Jasmine the respect he deserves. At 17 kids robbed $1.5 million. Most bank robbers don't even get that much. So the kid tripped up a little no reason to hate.

Now if we were malicious we could have taken credit card numbers and done that whole thing, but being innocent and God fearing, we instead did what any Grade 10 would do, and stole their personal chat logs and sent em around. Suffice to say a few yard fights broke out, friendships lost, couples destroyed, some people may even have gotten hospitalized, but all that aside it worked out ok, no one lost any loot.

I think some people suspected us, but back then with the internet as fresh as it was, no one really knew how to book us, and since I had just taught everyone and anyone, we weren't even an organized group, just a bunch of independent amateurs messing with peoples heads, no where in the same league as our friend Jasmine.
