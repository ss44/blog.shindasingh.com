[<img width="171" height="120" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/okdpayed-764929.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/okdpayed-766854.jpg)I was checking out some sites and came across this one, which lets you check up on charity tax returns, so I thought Id take a look at the various Gurdwaras around Canada, or at least the big ones and see how they are spending, so without further ado here we go:

**_Some notes about the above_**

  1. The financial years differ for various Gurdwaras, hence they are not all from the same annual period. The data used was that which was that for the most recently available.
  2. Im not a accountant or anything close. I jus tried to comprehend and understand the tax records best I could, so dont take the information above as fact.
  3. Money spent on Sangat category was derived from Section 5000, which had the header: _total charitable programs expenditures._
  4. All the above data was obtained using the [Charities Listing database tool](https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/sec/SrchLogin-e;) provided by [Canada Revenue Agency.](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/)
  5. Some of those Gurdwaras not listed were not listed due to me not being able to find them in the Database.
