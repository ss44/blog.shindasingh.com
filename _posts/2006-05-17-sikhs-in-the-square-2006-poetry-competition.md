Campaign84 and AKAAL Productions have organised a Poetry Competition in commemoration of the Victims of the Massacre of Operation Bluestar - 1984.

If you enjoy writing poems and have been hurt or feel the need to inspire others, by raising awareness of the terrible slaughter of Operation Bluestar, then we urge you to write your feelings down and submit them to us so we can come together to raise awareness for a better society.

The Dead Have No Voice, But The Living Do - Lets Use It!
