It's amazing the things you come across while randomly passing time looking at different [_Sikh_ blogs](http://blogpulse.sikhnet.com) from around the world.

Anyway's I came across this video from [Jagjit Singh's of Malaysia's blog](http://jagjit7.blogspot.com/), which reminds us to take a moment and reflect on the classics. Hopefully Singh won't mind that I jacked the video.
