Everyone's heard the saying, _"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"_, but no one ever said anything about the fury of a punjabi chic who got cheated on. 

This recent story about the punjabi bibi in the UK probably tops even some of more outlandish Jerry Springer themes and guests, and even though the incident is quite tragic and shouldn't be made light of, after reading the story one can't help but look at the situation and think WTF!?!?

Anyways check it out, some shit out there is just messed: [Sikh student jailed for stabbing of pregnant Muslim love rival](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=497453&in_page_id=1770).
