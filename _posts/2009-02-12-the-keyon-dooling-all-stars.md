If you know who Keyon Dooling is, then you know exactly what the Keyon Dooling All-Stars represent. If you don't, let me enlighten you with some knowledge.

To be a Keyon Dooling All-Star, a player must encompass one or more of the following characteristics:

  * Have the ability to bring your team back into a game either by scoring or energy or both
  * Have the ability to shoot your team out of a game
  * Is a role and/or bench player
  * Has brain cramps consistently on either Offense or Defense when he's out on the court
  * Gets overly excited after making a play or two
  * Has the ability to single handily shift the momentum for or against your team
  * When he usually shoots the ball, you hear yourself yelling "Nooooooooo!"
  * Makes you scratch your head and just say "What the fuck are you doing?"
  * Makes you get mad at the coach for putting him into the game

That pretty much covers all the characteristics of what one must have to earn such a dubious distinction.

And if you still don't get it, think of it this way. A Keyon Dooling All-Star is a player who doesn't know his roll. Pretty much like majority of girls nowadays who don't know their rolls and try to do too much.

Now that we've got the definitions out of the way, lets meet the All-Stars.

Keyon Dooling

Sasha Vujacic

Antoine Walker

Will Soloman

Mike James

Juan Dixon

Ronald Murray

Obviously this is just my list and it is constantly changing. However, once you're a Keyon Dooling All-Star, it's very hard to get off the list and very easy to get on.

If you have other players you'd like to nominate, please feel free to do so.
