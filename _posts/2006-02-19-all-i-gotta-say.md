</div></a>Check it, I liked Nate Robinson's dunks as much as the next guy, but in all honesty he didn't beat Iggy. So many tries just dont cut it. Yea I jumped out of my seat when I saw him pull what he pulled, but come on now, you dont get awarded a championship based on effort, its about what you produce.Nate had tons of heart, untouchable hops, and the sheer sight of a 5'7 getting that high is remarkable, but he just didn't hit his mark.NBA needs to put in a trial limit, or at least a time limit. 2 tries and your done, or you got 1 minute to complete your dunk/whatever trials you got.Ah well, I'll mark Iggy down for the winning, hence I was 2 for 3, with my predictions. All the same, best dunk comeptition, since Wince.<div>
