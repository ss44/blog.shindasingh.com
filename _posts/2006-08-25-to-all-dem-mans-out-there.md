I post this knowing good well that I'm going to get shit on like crazy for posting this, but something's are just to funny to pass up on. Be warned lyrics may offend.
  
With that said I'mma shout this video out to our man Govind from down under, who got married last weekend, and actually all the other rude bwoy Singh's who been getting married and taking on themselves the kurbani of marriage, this past summer, we'll remember yall.

Not exactly the type of songo a girl wants dedicated to her husband but then again what ch'a gonna do..

    Now that you've heard the audio, and corrupted your entire essence I suggest you <a href="http://www.onlinepeshi.com/">go here</a>. (Those who own that site, update it, for including having watched this blog!)
