I hate exams, but I love what they bring out in me, creativity.

The things that I think up and do while sitting here thinking of things to do other then study always astounds me. Although none of them ever help me in passing or ripping the exam, they are creative none the less. Examples of exam-time inspired ideas:

  * Gurdwara GMap's.
  * Laree-vaar STTM
  * Laree-vaar Hukamn aama feed.
  * Some videos I've made in the past.
  * Some of the small 84 video clips.

And a probabbly a bunch of other things all brought about, thanks to exams. Chulloo I've convinced myself that to go review my notes again so I'm done for now.

Now I could go and describe it all and try to justifiy the symbolism as I've seen others do, but lets face thats just a waste of time, and this really has no symbolic meaning. Its a picture I tried 2 make of me (yea right, someone had 2 make it for me). As for the dhara, only reason its missing is since the Dhara's used by that program all looked shaved I thought going for the pre-dhari stage of my life was better, then to make depcition of me with a dhari cut or tied.

Aaaakhooooo Saaaaaaaaatnaaam Sreee Vaaaaaaahegurooo Jeee..
