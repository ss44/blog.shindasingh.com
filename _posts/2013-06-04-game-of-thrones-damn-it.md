Still in disbelief over what happened, I can't even bare to revisit the events of the last episode (S03E09). As if the Leafs losing wasn't hard enough, and now this? I'd even shed a tear for the Pacers, except for the fact that they're the Pacers and I expected nothing less from them in the situation that they were in.

So not wanting to dwell and having never read the books here are my predictions for the future of this show:

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">Brann will get his Professor X on and take control over a dragon in some epic battle at some point. (c/o Mugsy Wugsy)</span>
  2. Aria will call up her super skilled assassin body guard, train in their ways, return and wreak revenge on all who wronged her family.
  3. John Snow will somehow do something bad ass, while being hunted by wild-lings.
  4. Since we love killing off people we come to adore Khaleesi will at some point be savagely murdered and we will all collectively curse George Martin, who continues to think his fans are Rihanna while modelling himself after Chris Brown.
  5. In a fight against the zombies they'll eventually discover that the metal from the first mans is their kryptonite and not just leave it behind like that dumb ass piggy.
