One of the biggest blemishes against the Panth in most recent times has had to have been Phoola, who for years paraded around with full immunity; raping, pillaging and murdering while all along masquerading as an Akali nihang.

I remember when I first heard about Phoola years ago; about how he was responsible for having murdered some Singhs from Jatha that were close to Baba Ji [Sant Baba Takhur Singh], and then going on to hear and read about his gross rapes, laundry list of murders, while himself never being touched or got at. While understanding the fear and power wielded by those who not only role deep but remain well connected through corrupt officials and bureaucrats, it remained a disgusting reality that very few ever tried bringing justice to the man. It was this legacy of heinous crimes, in addition to the fear and cowardice that his presence evoked, that would become a breathing blemish and his existance a matter of shame that long stained the Panth; a Panth that prides itself on bringing those like Phoola to justice.

Now, I mean no disrespect to anyone, I am no better or any less responsible for having never acted or attempting to have dared take a go at him. In the end anyone can be touched, and ultimately where there's a will there's a way, so I make no attempt to single anyone or any group out in particular, rather it's burden that for so long we all bore.

But as the history books tend to reveal; sooner or later life has a way of catching up and our past deeds become the weight with which our future is weighed against and judgement passed by. It's to this end that a man such as Phoola got no more a deserving death then to having been burned alive and suffering a slow and painful death. Not nearly as deserved for all the pain he brought to others, yet justice all the same.
