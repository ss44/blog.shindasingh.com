Carrying on from yesterdays post on immortal lyrics, heres a video I came across from a Toronto local (Kanwer Singh) that really hits on all the local social issues that have been happening over the past year.

From talking about [kids these days](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2007/05/14/kids-these-days/), and the whole [ghetto mentality](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2007/02/01/ghetto-fantasy/) that has engulfed many of them, to the epidemic on the West with the slaying's of the Bibian by there husbands, and families.

Apparently this video is only a prelude to a bigger and longer documentary or so I'm told that is dropping in July of 2008, so definitely keep an eye out for that.
