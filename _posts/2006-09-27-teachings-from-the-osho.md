Came across this video of Osho discussing the unexpected consequences of Nitzche's remarks, "God is dead". Personally I think I Osho is an idiot, not so much because of the content of the video, but just him in general, and his views/remarks on Sikhi almost put him to sail in the same boat as Gandhi. Anyway's, check out the video and be warned it does contain language that seems to bother a handful of individuals, so now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
