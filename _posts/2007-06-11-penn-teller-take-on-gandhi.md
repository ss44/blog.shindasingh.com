I'm trying not to slump back into the ways of youtub'ing videos on a daily but some vidoes just stick out, and I figure this is the easiest means to share them.

  There were a few others in the series on a similar note that focused on exposing the Dali Lama, and Mother Theresa which I've also included below.

  As for Gandhi I'm not a fan, but as far as the&nbsp;Dali Lama and Mother Therersa go, I doubt that they're near as evil as made out to be and the videos don't add near as much credability or fuel to any fire or movement against them. Instead it would seem that it's just an attempt to stir contraversy&nbsp;to insite&nbsp;discussion on the matter,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it does provide some food for thought, while being entertaining at the same time.

  <strong>Note - the videos do&nbsp;contain language, and racial stereotypes&nbsp;that&nbsp;some may find offensive, so do note that you've been warned.</strong>
