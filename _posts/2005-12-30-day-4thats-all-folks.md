So today marked the final day of the ball camp. Seemed like the kids all had fun, and a continuous flow of youth kept coming in, with each day having more then the last. Some would consider that an organizers nightmare, but not the organizers behind this event; they were more like water, and knew how to flow and adjust with the change with the terrain.

Today was basically a wrap up of the entire week, where all the skills that had been practiced, via the countless layup, defense, boxing out and shooting drills, was put to the test, in game situations.

It's impossible to teach everything and impossible to fix all areas of one persons game in such limited time, but I think all players noticed that they all came out better and improved, because it showed, and hopefully this little clinic will be enough to get people onto their school teams.

Highlights from the camp include:

  * Bougaloo teaching kids how to box out.
  * "Put the man on yo back"
  * "This is your house, if that man scores, he just disrespected you. Don't let no one disrespect you in your own house." 

  * Mugsy. 
  * What can I say Mugsy's, a highlight real. The black flash.

  * Quick Wick
  * Working his squad on day 1 and 2 as if it was military camp.

  * Big Tony
  * Running the kids as if it was military camp.

  * Gagan
  * Thinking he's a wicked coach, because he took an all star team to the finals and won.
  * Coaching like Jeff Van Gundy on the Knicks.
  * Appl 

  * Shinda
  * I'm ill, this is my blog and I'mma big myself up for the sake of it. 
  * I was the Sam Mitchell of this camp: an able coach with a team full of potential who just needed some more work and practice together, before we could win a game. 

For all yall who doubted me, just wait. Shinda Saingh is back in training. I'mma start my workout routine again this semester, adding focus to my cardio (time to get back my speed and stamina).

Bougaloo needs to watch his back also, come summer I'm going to be slamming on him once again, giving Mugsy a reason to scream, <span style="font-style: italic;">"in ya mout' "..</p> 

<p>
  </span>Now yall can enjoy some pictures and clips from today (More to be on <a href="http://www.sikhstudents.ca">SikhStudents.ca</a> - coming soon).

Bougaloo taking a page from the Zenmaster while Gagan acts as erratic as Van Gundy.

  <p>
    <br /> Dirty block to start, and to add insult to injury Gagans squad gets the offensive board.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <br /> Trying to make a move..With defense like this, you can see why Gagan took the championship.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <br /> Its all about respect in the end na saying.
