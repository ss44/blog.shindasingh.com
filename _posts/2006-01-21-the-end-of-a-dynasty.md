      Last Friday at sports, we saw one of the greatest soccer teams ever assembled retire on top. Satgur day Neelay officially disbanded finishing the season 5-2 against K.S.F.

      There were times this season when it looked like K.S.F was going to make a run, but due to lack of team chemistry, unreliable players and overall lack of skill compared to S.D.N they quickly found themselves at the short end of the stick.

      All this amalgamated led to the actions of Friday when the teams were disbanded and a new dynasty was formed, seeing the new competition being between Ottawa Vs. Toronto.

      Although Ottawa won the first game in the series, this had much to do with the early injury of Tejdeep Singh, and the absence of Ranjit Sion from the Toronto line up. However after barley squeaking by winning 3 games to 2, and only a goal away from loosing the last, Ottawa got lucky this time, but WHAT will they do next time with a healthy Toronto squad? I guess only time will tell.
