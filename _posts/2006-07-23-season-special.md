<span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.5em"><strong>THIS YEAR ONLY</strong>...</span>in celebration of 400 years of Sri Akal Takhat Sahib, all patit's who have been kicked out of the panth, can re-join now, with NO, thats right NO! down-payment, no commitment, NO Tankhaah nothing. Come and be forgiven.

  * Killed 13 Singhs in 1978...NOOOOOOOOOOOOO Problem.
  * Changed Gurbani to suit your needs and got excommunicated by Guru Sahib themselves? Thats OK!! Come and be forgiven, with no punishment.
  * Those hundreds of people who have been ex-communicated in the last 10 years, come now and don't worry about any Tankah....

Thats right folks this week only, re-join the Panth with NOO Tankah!!.

Honestly, this has got to be the single most stupid thing that Vedanti has ever done. He's becoming as embarrassing as George W with this one. Lets look at this for what it really is, a political charade cloacked in the guise of a celebration. After the recent ex-communication of Mann, a few weeks back, only to reverse his decision a minute later, after feeling the grumbling roar of the Sikh Panth, the Jatehdar goes to save face for all the other bad decisions by holding a free for all peshi. Basically admitting to having made un-precedented decisionsin the past, (those every other week ex-communications) and therefore decides to quietly cover it up, by letting those same people re-join the Panth with no consequence. At the same time, to help keep things quiet and covered up, rather then offering this immunity to only those who got excommunicated under the Vedanti tenure, why not open things up to anyone who's been excommunicated in the last 400 years. End of the day, don't believe the hype, and don't let the man fool you. All this really is, is an admit-ion of guilt on having acted/reacted in the wrong way. Come on Vedanti, please just grow some balls and ex-communicate the one person the Sikh Panth is really sick of, Badal, be like Nike and _Just Do It._

For those scratching their heads as to what all the above was about the article is attached below:

</p>

> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Amritsar, July 21<br />In an unprecedented 'Gurmata' (literally Guru's intention), passed unanimously in presence of Guru Granth Sahib, today gave choice to all excommunicated persons to rejoin the Sikh fold by January 13, 2007 without undergoing any 'Tankhah' (punishment) on the pre-condition that they accept the authority of Akal Takht, 'Granth and Panth'.</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Jathedar Akal Takht, Joginder Singh Vedanti, who read the 'Gurmata' from the rostrum of the Takht, here, said that those who had gone astray 'intentionally or un-intentionally' from the Sikh fold could themselves avail the special exemption given to them to mark quadricentennial century of 'Miri Piri' (foundation of Akal Takht) .</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Later talking to The Tribune, Jathedar Vedanti said that the 'Gurmatta' was meant for all including Nirankaris, who were excommunicated after the Sikh-Nirankari clash on April 13, 1978. The Gurmatta was pronounced to mark the 'Miri-Piri Divas', which was postponed for today after clash on July 2.</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The Sikh scholars feel that this was for the first time in the 400 years of the foundation of Akal Takht that any excommunicated Sikh was given an opportunity to re-join the Sikh fold without undergoing any atonement. 'Ramraias , Minas , Dheermalias etc had been excommunicated from the Sikh Panth since the Guru's period.</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The important personalities, who were excommunicated in recently included Joginder Singh, a editor of daily Spokesman, Canada-based Mr Gurbax Singh Kalaafghana and certain foreign-based Sikhs who were punished for violating the 'Hukmnama' (edict) on Langar issue.</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Meanwhile, Jathedar, Akal Takht has imposed a ban on any type of sloganeering, especially 'Zindabad-Murdabad' in any gurdwara premises of the world.</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The Sikh clergy has also banned press conferences in gurdwara premises. However, Bhai Mohkam Singh, a spokesman of the Damdami Taksal said that Jathedar, Akal Takht must direct the SGPC to provide suitable place for the press conferences for rival Panthic factions since the Badal faction had already been using the Shiromani Committee's offices.</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">In another significant pronouncement, Jathedar Akal Takht said that 'both Jehangir and Dewan Chandu' were responsible for the martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev. This pronouncement from Akal Takht has come as great setback to the Shiromani Akal Dal, led by Mr Parkash Singh Badal since Ms Sushma Swaraj, a senior BJP leader had given a clean chit to Dewan Chandu from the Akali Dal's stage. On this, Mr Paramjit Singh Sarna, President Delhi Akali Dal (New Delhi) has appreciated Jathedar Vedanti for his 'bold statement'.</span>
> 
> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">However, the 'Pashtap Divas' passed off peacefully though senior leaders of the Badal faction, including Mr Parkash Singh Badal, and his party MLAs/MPs, Brig K.S.Kahlon and other factions, including Mr Simranjit Singh Mann, Mr Daljit Singh Bittu, Mr Kanwarpal Singh, Mr Satnam Singh Paunta Sahib and a large number of SGPC members were present on the occasion. The Task Force of the SGPC was on high alert for any eventuality. Jathedar Akal Takht, was the only person to address the Sikh Sangat.</span>
