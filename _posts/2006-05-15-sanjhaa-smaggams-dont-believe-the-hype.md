Somethings that's been rumored to be happening in Toronto this summer is "an ever so needed Sanjha Smaggam", and from what I've heard a similar one will be happening in BC also. What is a Sanjha Smaggam? Its an everyone can come and do kirtan smaggam, a "neutral ground" where everyone can get together regardless of Jatha and sit down and do Kirtan together.

Amazing, you must be thinking. A Sanjha Smaggam what could be more perfect? A Kirtan where everyone for one day sits together regardless of jathabandi and listens to and enjoys kirtan.

Now I don't know about UK, from what I hear things are pretty messed up; in that there's a lot of hostility between different groups, Nihangs getting jumped by AKJ's, Taksalis getting jumped by Nihangs the whole circle of violence.So a day of peace where everyone can sit together and listen to Kirtan, what could be better? Making the Sanjhaa Smaggam into a Peace rally of sorts, what could be better.

Now I don't know if BC is like the UK, if there is the whole divide between groups, last I heard and from what I know there isn't, but I don't live there, so who knows. Sure you got Jatha's but they all co-exist as far as Toronto, I know that not everyone agrees with everyone, and people have there differences, but nothing to the point where two groups can't exist in the same place at the same time.

Leading me to my real question, a Sanja Smaggam, why?!? Its like holding a day of Peace where we ask all the street gangs to put away there guns and knives, in a suburb where their is no gang, let alone violence.

_But SINGH!!! A venue where all Jatha's can sit together and do Kirtan, regardless of the Maryada they follow!!_ 

Last I remember there was no bar on people from doing kirtan on an AKJ stage, as long as they were amritdhari and had an keski (and could actually do Kirtan) they were good to go, just had to get in line. I've also been to programs done by Taksal, where I've seen people from various groups sit on the same stage and do Kirtan.

_"But those programs all have titles, they are jatha affiliated programs".._

Fair enough. But what about the programs that happen at almost every Guru Ghar everyday? Most Gurdwara Sahibs have various individuals representing a wide array of jatha's on any given day. Take Dixie from a few years back (been awhile since I last went there). In the mornings a Keertan Jatha repping Jwadi Taksal does kirtan/asa dee vaar. In the afternoon a kathavahic from Taksal does Katha. Then at night AKJ leads the Sangat in simran. How can you get more Sanjha then that? Or you can even take Malton, from when I remember, Dharnaa styled Simran in the morning, popular kirtan style kirtan through out the day, Lareevar katha in the afternoon, AKJ style Simran at night. From what I know things are still like this, so whats not "Sanjha" about that? Or even more obvious what about the Kirtan Darbaars done by various SSA's and COSS like Western, Waterloo and York in the past year? Last I remember, kirtanis ranged from all over the place, from classical raag kirtanis with their "sa re ga maa's", AKJ's with there "groo grooo" intensified simran, and even Dodra Kirtani's with their trademark "Dharn Guru Nanak" line, shouldn't all these be labelled as Sanjha also?

I don't know maybe I'm ranting over nothing, but it just doesnt make sense to hold a big ol' peace rally when no ones at war. Instead you enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, since isn't that what these Sanjha Smaggams hope to accomplish anyways?

Like I said, don't believe the hype. In my eyes all these Sanjha Smaggams are really doing is putting a negative light on a situation that doesn't even exist. Trying to say that there's problems when there are none.

Be warned, don't fall victim to the hype.
