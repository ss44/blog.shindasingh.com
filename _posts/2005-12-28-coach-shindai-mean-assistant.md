As you all should know by now, today was day 2 of the COSS - Basketball Camp. There's about 30-35 kids, which although may seem like a small group, is relatively large when you look at the size of the gym and the amount of time set for the camp. Its also not bad considering the only advertising done for it was to put it up on 2, 3 message boards, and then forward the poster around 3 days before the camp was due to start.

Maybe next time around we'll go for a bigger gym, and try to spread word a little sooner, one can only imagine the results.

Anyways today I actually stayed the duration, and was able to help out. Be honest I haven't been around the grassroots level basketball since I was in grade 9. After that I stopped trying to play rep, and left the intramural scene all together. By grade 11 competitive basketball became a thing of the past, and come OAC casual pick up ball became annual pick up ball. So a lot of things about this camp brings back memories of my glory days, (at least these days I'm on the other side of the fence, telling people to run suicides while I sit back and watch).

So today I was helping Nav run drills and realized how much I've forgotten, not just from the type of drills but including the fundamentals such as which leg your supposed to go up with when doing a layup). Lucky for me, the Toronto Khalsa/Kharkoo's ball guys know what they're doing, and all I have to do is regurgitate there advice as if it was my own.

Anyways enough of that, now to what most 'yall came here for in the first place, the pictures. (Only got a few worth posting, since someone didn't replace batteries).
