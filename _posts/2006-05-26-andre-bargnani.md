A lot of people have been hating on Bargnani without ever really seeing him play or seeing exactly what he's capable of it. Most people are on the Aldridge, Gay bandwagon simply because they've seen them play throughout the last NCAA season, but then again how many of us ever really get a chance to watch the Euro league.

Colangelo was saying that we'll be seeing a lot more players coming out of Europe in the near future simply because, the level of competition there although not NBA, surpasses that of College ball, in other words the the best Euro player is better then the best NCAA player. It's impossible to weight in on this just yet, but so far the success of Euro players in the leauge seems to speak for itself. Anyways here are some more videos of Andre Bargnani that were posted on YouTube, although I'm in no place to judge whether or not he'll live up the hype, you got to believe that Colangelo knows what he's talking about, the Phoenix Suns are a living testament to that.

Anyways here are Bargnani's stats for the night (copped this from RealGM):
