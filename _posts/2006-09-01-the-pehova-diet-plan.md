Are you having trouble loosing those excess pounds? Find that your lavish life style as a Baba is providing you with way to much to eat? Then try the new Pehova Wale diet, guaranteed to help you shed those pounds in no time. 

The Pehova Wale diet was perfected in 2006 by none other then Pehova's favourite rapist, Baba Mann Sion himself. It entails running, hiding and more running. How the diet works is simple and you can get it to work for you in no time.&nbsp;Simply follow these simple instructions:

  1. Grab a crisp white cholaa and say you're the [real heir to the Rara Sahib dynasty](http://www.theworldofgurunanak.com/Sant%20Samprda.htm), and how you and &nbsp;[Sant Baba Ishar Singh Ji go way back.](http://www.theworldofgurunanak.com/History%20of%20Mann.htm)
  2. [Memorize Sakhi's](http://www.theworldofgurunanak.com/Audio.htm) from Sant Jarnail Singh and Sant Ishar Singh tapes then tell them over and over again adding your own twists and turns each time.<a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/WindowsLiveWriter/ThePehovaDietPlan_9424/bottled%20water1_1%5B10%5D.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="131" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/WindowsLiveWriter/ThePehovaDietPlan_9424/bottled%20water1_1_thumb%5B8%5D.jpg" width="186" align="right" border="0" /></a>
  3. Start telling people you're Guru Gobind Singh in disguise but to keep this secret on the down low.
  4. Mass produce Amrit and start shipping it out. 
  5. Put your closest chelay to a Kaam test, and say its your way of testing there loyalty and Sikhi.
  6. Get [Internet stooges](http://www.sikhsangat.com/index.php?s=&showtopic=20658&view=findpost&p=190686) to run circular logic games on message boards and hire the same stooges to act as your PR spin doctors.
  7. When Sangat does approach....[RUN](http://www.panthic.org/news/123/ARTICLE/2598/2006-07-02.html)...

Just repeat the following everywhere you go and you'll see those excess pounds disappear in no time, and don't forget to run, because just like the motto goes, "run, run, run, as fast as you can, you can't catch him he's from Pehovaa Maaan".
