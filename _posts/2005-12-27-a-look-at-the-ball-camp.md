Every break, winter, march, summer, we've always tried to do something for the kids under COSS. This winter although kind of last minute, a basketball camp was put together.

Originally it was supposed to be both a ball and stick hockey thing, but then due to the nature of the break, it was hard to book gym time and costs where getting steep. Luckily Mandeep, and Parminder Singh were able to book the gym time at the Malton Community Center, so for this week (27th - 30th) between 12 - 3PM the ball guys and volunteers from various SSA's will be hosting this skills development camp.

I was able to drop in at the start so I took some pictures.

    </a>The highlight of the day, or the 20 mins that I was there was when Mugsy crossed out Mr. Chardi Kalaa, breaking his ankles in front of everyone there. Conveniently no CK camera's where there to tape it.

      Lastly I spent my day working at my dads office, and I was surprised to see that the office is really starting to look like an office, a lot has changed since I was last in town, check out the completed lobby.
