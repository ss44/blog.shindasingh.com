Im going to introduce a new feature here on the blog. Once a month Im going to post a real confession from a female driver. Some of these may be positive experiences but lets face it, more so than not, they will be negative experiences that occured while she behind the wheel of a car. Actually, Im going to try to make this a weekly feature because lets face it, I can find at least one confession per week without even looking too hard.

Also, let me just say (contrary to popular belief) Im not doing this to hate on women. Just rather to speak the truth or in this case, let the females speak the truth themselves. Im just providing a medium in which they can use to share their humiliating, comedic or just plain stupid stories. Remember, dont shoot the messenger.

And I also plan on doing a weekly mailbag in which you, the reader, can email us here on any subject you have a question about. Questions like if how do you tell a female in your family that they need to go back to driving school. Or which jathabandi you should join based on your personality. Feel free to ask questions such as these and many more. Just [click here](mailto:mailbag@shindasingh.com) to send us an email.

Anyways, that is in the future. For today, let me bring you my first confession.

Remember, there are stories from real female drivers on roads and in cars similar to yours (or at least at one point were).

I dont have my car right now. Its in the shop getting repaired. I backed into a pole a few times and it needs a new bumper now but thats ok, now I just drive my brothers car. Look (points to the cars left rear fender) I scratched up his car as well.

So far this female is the only person Ive met who was not only proud of the fact that she hit her own car into a pole but went out of our way to show us how and where she hit her brothers car. And to top it all off, she proudly proclaimed Im probably gonna do it again.

Well thats it for this week and remember kids, its better to walk than to let her drive you anywhere.
