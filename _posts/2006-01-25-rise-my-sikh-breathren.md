I got this in an email from Jaswinder Singh, and it was to good to pass up not posting here, so here yall go:

> I present to you two religions, Islam-monotheistic religion with salvation as ultimate consequence; Sikhi  also monotheistic with submission of self as fore longing goal. Both religions condemn consumption of alcohol and stress the necessity of congregation. The question I raise before you is then, why is it a known fact that Muslims are known to have the prohibition of alcohol and my non-sikh friends are just flabbergasted when I tell them I dont drink for religious reasons. I thought youre Punjabi though? The usual remarks. We cant really blame it on any external forces or even internal attitudes for that mater; the problem is much deeper than we think. Even in congregation, a Sikh is said to attend the Gurus durbar at least once a day. The Muslim is given the incentive of higher rewards to attend congregational prayer. Why is the Mosque down my street so busy during noon hours on a weekday and Scarborough Gurduara has a total of 16 people during Sunday afternoons ardaas?
> 
> Were suffering from a deep-seeded fear. A fear of disintegration. We have a subconscious notion, that were not for real, that were a people not fit for the modern times. We have no nation of our own that stands up for our rights and supports our spiritual authority. We have no representation on the United Nations council, no International Racism-combating, thing-a-majiggy or a Sikhi-wood. We watch Hindi movies for entertainment and tell my younger sister that she should watch it too, to understand our culture..wait a minute..trolley back.OUR CULTURE?...I dont see these guys with a dastaar or a beard.right.neither does our next generation.
> 
> We can overcome this fear; come together my fellow Lovers of Guru Nanak. Whether its AKJ, Taksaal, Alkali, blah blah blah..youre a Sikh. Lets have more events to come together. I learnt this in Biology: When an Ostrich is being chased, it runs for a bit, and then sticks its head into the ground and thinks the danger is gonefew moments later.it whispers Im in a better place in Sylvia Brownes ear whos handling a grieving farmer. Were the Ostrich. The way we ignore danger is to bring our fellow Sikhs down and discourage them from doing events. We criticize them and make fun of them and say theyll never succeed. Why? At least they know were in danger and are still running, you put your head in the ground and resorted to slandering.
> 
> YUDH, COSS keertan Durbars, COSS Dinner Night, Ski tripslets get together. I urge one and all to help my friends make Friday a night a success, come to the COSS dinner. This is not a marketing pitch; I speak from the bottom of my heart. Come to every Sikh event.will it be effective in conquering our fear? I dont know, well see then. In The Lord of the Rings, in the final siege of Gondor to save humanity, Theoden King yells, ride Theodens, ride to ruin, ride to the sword, a red day, ere the sun shines, ride to death, to DEATH. Lets give our community all we have, and maybe our sons and daughters will thank us. We will prosper, we will not disappear. GURBAR AKAAL!!!
