Ever wonder what your favourite Sikhi site ranks as? Or how sites compare? So who better to ask then Google.

Google's got this thing called Page Ranks, that basically sees how popular your site is based on who links to it. The more links you got pointing to your site the better. Also the more popular the sites that link to your site, the more that links worth. Put all that information through a magic equation and you get a page rank out of 10, on how popular your site is. So I took a bunch of sites, that I know from the top of my head and compiled this list:

  1. Sikhnet.com - 7
  2. Sikhs.org - 7
  3. SGPC.net - 6
  4. SikhSangat.com - 5
  5. Waheguroo.com - 5
  6. AllAboutSikhs.com - 5
  7. Panthic.org - 5
  8. SikhiToTheMax.com - 5
  9. GursikhiJeevan.com - 4
 10. AKJ.org - 4
 11. GurmatVeechar.com - 4
 12. DDT.com - 4
 13. Tapoban.org - 4
 14. EktaOne.com - 4
 15. SikhStudents.ca - 2
 16. ShindaSingh.com - 0

And just for reference sites like Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, etc, are 9's.
