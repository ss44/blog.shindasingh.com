  With the playoffs done, and the Lakers out, looks like Shaq is going to add his 2 cents on what he thinks of Kobe's performance. While I had the lakers winning the series in 6, I'm glad that Garnett was able to get himself a ring. Anyways <a href="http://pindgagan.com">Sarpanch Sahib</a> this videos directed at you, and your man Kobe.
