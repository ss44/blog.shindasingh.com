The following clip was from 2 nights ago, covering the Surrey Nagar Kirtan that happened just a little while ago. Looks like CBC's at it again, if there coverage of Air India Bombing wasn't bad enough now they're going to try and go after the community as a whole as being misguided and taken advantage of. 

I don't see where they get the ISYF logo being on the akhara jackets, last I remember ISYF had the world with the falcon on it as there emblem, and also since when haven't Khalistan Jakaray gone off at the Surrey Nagar Kirtan?
