Here's a&nbsp;clip from last weekends Jor Melaa that happened in Surrey, BC. The atmosphere seems pumping with the Sangat really into the match,&nbsp;creating for what&nbsp;seems to be an&nbsp;amazing atmosphere. What really impressed me with the whole thing was the reffing, which is usually one of the most sensitive areas in such competitions. I liked how the 3 refs around the edges were&nbsp;all active, and working together&nbsp;with everyone&nbsp;seeming to be actively judging the match. Although this doesn't necessarily eliminate missed calls or objectionable calls it does seem to reduce them, making for what would seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fairer matches, albeit longer ones. 

The below match&nbsp;match pits, two of the current top Gatka players in North America, Sukhjinder&nbsp;and Teghbir Singh, both students of the late Charnjit Singh,&nbsp;against one another. Both have also&nbsp;participated in past Yudhs with Teghbir&nbsp;being the&nbsp;Yudh champion from&nbsp;2004 while Sukhjinder impressed the Sangat this year by finishing first in the Kirpaan Demo, and fended of elimination against some of the&nbsp;top competitors, and his match against Jarnail was one for the ages. 

Hopefully more&nbsp;videos from Jor Melaa will find there way online, likewise with videos from past Yudhs.

      Hopefully we can see the rivalry grow and have a rematch of sorts at&nbsp;the next Yudh; which is slated to happen in the summer of 2007.
