I hate gandhi, have hated Gandhi and will probabbly forever despise the man who is so falsely misrepresented as being the leader of India's independence. None the less he is the father of India, so when a video of him performing a strip tease surfaced on youtube a month ago, the fools down in India's government quickly took notice, and are now trying to get the video banned from youtube and looking into banning YouTube.

None the less I have to thank the Indian media for bringing the video to my attention since I thought it was pretty funny although the joke does run a little long, but then again I guess anything bashing Gandhi will make my day.

Note the video is disturbing so if you have sensitivity issues, then you're better of not watching it.
