One teacher said, "I felt like they were all moving...but slowly. Kind of like, they were breathing."

The pictures attached are used to test the level of stress a person can handle.

The slower the pictures move, the better your ability of handling stress.

Alleged criminals that were tested see them spinning around madly; however, senior citizens and kids see them standing still.

**None** of these images are animated - they are **perfectly still...**
