I was sitting in class (business managmenet) and at the end of the class during Q & A this girl asks, how should you deal in a situation where you're a manager and the employees are your friends or family, or should u not do it at all, and what came to mind was:

> "Keep your family and business completely seperated
  
> Money and blood donÂ’t mix like two *\*\\*\* and no \*\*\***. Find yourself in serious shit"
