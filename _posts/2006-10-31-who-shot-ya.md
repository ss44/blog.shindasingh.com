    It was on this day in 1984, that Mrs. Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her morally conscious body guards, Shaheed Satwant Singh and Shaheed Beant Singh, in retaliation to her orchestrating and conducting the sacrileges assault against the holiest shrine of the Sikhs, Sri Harmandar Sahib, and demolition of the Sikhs temporal seat of authority in the Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib.She was also charged and convicted by the bullets that riddled her body for carrying on a silent genocide of Sikh youth's from across Punjab and India under guise of fighting terrorism.

    Her death, frustrated and attacked the very core of the Bhramin psyche who foolishly felt/feels that they were and continue to be, untouchable and above any and all laws. In retaliation the Indian Goverment led by the Congress Party of India, and its Ministers orchestrated the genocide of Sikhs; slaughtering upwards of a tens of thousand citizens (within 4 days), all in a vain attempt to flex its might and regain any sense of authority and control over the region.
