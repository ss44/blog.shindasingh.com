Maybe it's just me, but I&nbsp;wonder why they&nbsp;get to be&nbsp;"ultra-Orthodox" when most others get labeled as being fanatics or extremists, when in most cases, (neglecting suicide bombers and those out for the blood of the innocent), the words simply try to describe&nbsp;those who practice or at least attempt to practice&nbsp;their faith in&nbsp;as much of an un-adultered form as possible. 

Yet the difference in connotation is often simply ignored.
