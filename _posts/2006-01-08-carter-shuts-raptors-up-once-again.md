This was probably one of the best raptors game that I've seen since the Raptors game 7 against the sixers almost 3 (or was it 4) years back when Carter missed his shot at the buzzer. But I guess Carter came back to teach Raptors fans to never doubt him again, hitting that 3 pointer leaving 0.1 seconds left in the game.For more info on the game check out this [ESPN Article.](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260108028)The game was tight, but the writers an idiot, when he writes,> Toronto's [Morris Peterson](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3420) was ejected for slapping Carter in the face. Peterson got a technical for arguing a no-call late in the first half. About a minute later, Carter playfully slapped his ex-teammate in the face. Peterson, clearly annoyed, then slapped Carter.Anyone who watched the game knows that Mo-Pete and Carter where only clowning, but the referee in his infinite stupidness ejected Peterson for who knows what, and to add insult to injury slapped the Raptors with a few technicals.Personally I think Mo-Pete would have made all the difference as did those technicals, but I guess it wasn't to be. Can't hate on Carter for that performance, actually I can and will considering I traded Carter a while ago in fantasy and since then he started dropping 30 points a night again. And surprise surprise Jefferson (who I just traded for) sat out after 2 minutes, of play, which as Mandeep would say was a deuce.Now that I got that of my chest I think I can move on with life.
