As most of you probably the Canadians captured in Iraq a few months ago were successfully rescued by Allied Forces about a week back. All hostages were Christian peace activists, and the more that is revealed about the story, the more ironies surrounding it seem to pop up.

  * For instance peace activists saved by the allied forces whose very presence they are protesting against.
  * James Loney is gay, a secret kept out of the media to prevent any word of it getting to his captors who would have used that as a reason to kill him on site. (Last I remember homosexuality wasnt looked to highly upon in [Islam](http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_isla2.htm)).
  * When I was working at the MPs office, more then 80% of the people who called, emailed, or otherwise contacted the office protesting the Same Sex marriage legislation were from various Christian groups, however the fact that this was a Christian peace activist, whilst also being gay seems well ironic.

The news has for sure gotten back to those who are committing these abductions in Iraq, and after hearing of such things I can only imagine that their peers arent looking at them so fondly right now for letting those activists survive, so could this be the end to any future leniency that other hostages may have had?
