In recent years Nihangs have once again taken the lime light,  whether or not they ever left is a topic on its own. All the same though it holds true that when anyone comes to learn of 'em there is an instant attraction to the  romantic ideals of what it means to be a Nihang. The entire no-mad warrior. The rebel with a cause so above yours that you'll never catch up. Lets face it everything about Nihangs at first glance is just amazing.

But, for as much love as we give our unforsaken warrior brethren, we are quick to push the same people away, and try to create as much distance with their practices deeming them barbaric, satanic, bhamanistic and essentially leaving them to be a Panth within a Panth.

Which seems to be the exact summary of this upcoming feature documentary on Nihangs which reads,

> "The Akali Nihang claim direct lineage from the founding Gurus of Sikhism. Their itinerant lifestyle, rites and rituals have been sanctioned from the time of the sixth Sikh Guru - Hargobind Singh.
> 
> <div id="description">
>   Yet as Sikhism has grown and spread around the globe, the Nihang have been outcast by their own people. Once seen as heroes and demi gods, they are now villified as thieves and drug addicts.</p> 
>   
>   <p>
>     This is their story and the story of how a major world religion lost its way."

  While it would be fitting for me to warn those with weak stomachs, mild tempers, or foreign objects lodged high up their rectums to maybe turn away and skip the following video, the fact that many of you still visit this site leads me to believe that you wouldn't really heed such warnings anyways.
