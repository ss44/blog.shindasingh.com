So yesterday I [posted the Greatest Jordan commercial](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2006/03/greatest-jordan-commercial.html) to date, where it featured how Jodans game has touched us all. Well here's the remix with Jordan doing the moves himself. (Not the complete thing but hey whatcha gonna do).

Differences between this and the real one...

  * dribbling the ball side-to-side in front of his legs using only one hand
  * the up and under was the la lakers game where he faked the dunk and then made the layup with his left hand 
  * no clip of him chewing gum
  * no clip of him pulling up his shorts while defending
  * no footage of him palming the ball away from the defender
  * and no clip of him shooting a fade away
