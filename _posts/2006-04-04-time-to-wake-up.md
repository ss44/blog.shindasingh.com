Just when it looked like things were getting better for Sikhs in the West, this idiot goes out and does something stupid. Now I'm fully aware every religion/culture has its share of bad apples and black sheep, but none the less this is probably one of the most disgusting things people can do (hustle sex from minors). Now its bad enough that he's doing what he's doing, but whats worse is the fact that he's got a Sikhi Saroop (full dhara and full kes), identifying him as a Singh of Guru Gobind Singh to the world.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm all for exposing and defaming these kunjars, and I'm fully aware that Inderjeet isn't the only one, after all child molestation, whether we admit to it or not is a huge problem within our community. Exploitation of our mothers, sisters and daughters has been going on for a while now, and the problem has only been getting worse in recent years. Look at the [news headlines](http://www.sanjhsavera.com/msbheva.html) in the [recent months](http://www.panthic.org/news/123/ARTICLE/2002/2005-11-19.html), many big time precharaks, kirtani's, raagi's have been exposed, while Sri Akaal Takht Sahib conveniently turns a blind eye, giving these perps the occasional [slap on the wrist](http://www.panthic.org/news/125/ARTICLE/2372/2006-04-02.html), even then only under Sangat's watchful eye.

Long gone it seems are the days of Akali Phoola Singh, who gave even Maharaajaa Ranjit Singh lashes for associating with a muslim a bibi, but then again maybe its time we bring those days back, scare the perverseness right out of these perps.

The fact that Inderjeet got caught and exposed the way he did, on national prime time news, only confirms my belief that Guru Sahib is sending us a clear warning. Showing us that if we dont start to deal with and handle these problems from within properly then they will continue to leak out and over into the mainstream, and the Khalsa, once known for being the savior of the daughters of others, will have failed at protecting its very own.
