Disturbing stories from india are a dime a dozen, but this one is on it's own level. How do parents even begin dealing with this kind of grief?Politicians will be quick to brush this story under the rug, don't want a story like this staining their public image; a symptom of a society where image means more than substance.

Can only wonder why no news about the Dr's arrest or why the organs were removed aren't being answered. Even with time there is no happy ending to a story like this, and what kind of justice will ever be just? Maybe this was a freak accident, a one in a billion allergic reaction, a mishap in labelling, but a young girl is gone, and her family may never get the closure they need all while a cynical darker underbelly of Punjab and India's black-market are potentially brought to the lime light. One so vile, that will make parents all over fear for the safety of their loved ones from the very ones trusted to protect them. Her parents fortunately had a voice to raise there questions and get some attention to this tragically disturbing news. Makes you wonder about all those who didn't.
