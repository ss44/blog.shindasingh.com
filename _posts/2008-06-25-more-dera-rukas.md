I came to know about the recent dera riots only the other day. I havn't really been paying attention to any panthic news for the last little while, but usually when something big happens the news just finds its own way of travelling. Which made the news of the current riots that much more surprising since even fewer people knew about them, and when I did go to ask around, I found I wasn't the only one in the dark about what was happening.

The underlying story is about the same, Ram Rahim was in Bombay, and a group of Sikhs showed up to protest. Someone in the babas entourage opened fire, prefixing Bhai Balkar Singh, with the honary title of Shaheed. This off course led to even more riots and more protests, and for the most part that's where things have been since Friday it would seem.

I really got nothing to add to the story, and like most others in the dark, I'm just trying to piece together what's what. All the same, as is customary when crisis like this happens the news is often slow to trickle out, especially from reliable sources.

Here are some vids I pulled off of youtube that highlight just some of the agitation that's going on and check out [Panthic.org](http://panthic.org) for updates. Also while the blogsphere is pretty dead on the whole thing there is one blog in particular - <http://gururamdass.blogspot.com/>, which seems ahead of the curb on the happenings.

Anywyas here are some of the vids I scoured from youtube, and I noticed there are even a few others on facebook in addition to groups that seem to be filling up quick with updates, pics and other tid bits so if you're on that check those out.
