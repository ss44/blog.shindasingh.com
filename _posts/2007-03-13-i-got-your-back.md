There's nothing more impressive in sports, and&nbsp;that&nbsp;shows more character, then when a player sticks up for another&nbsp;teammate. There's no better way to get the fans behind you then showing them that you're there for the team and not yourself.&nbsp;Just that listen you can foul me all day, but you&nbsp;touch my boy&nbsp;and its on mentality, not only makes the fans respect you that&nbsp;much more, but it goes to help solidify that&nbsp;notion that the team really is one cohesive unit.&nbsp;

Maybe that's why when&nbsp;seeing Ford come to the aide of Bosh and get into it with Bogut&nbsp;you can't help but to get&nbsp;goose bumps crawl&nbsp;up and down your&nbsp;spine. After all this is the second time this season when&nbsp;we have really seen&nbsp;the Raptors&nbsp;act as a team, in the I really got your back sense.&nbsp;Just like the time when we saw Garbojosa all distraught and actually worried when his boy Calderon hit the floor those many games ago. Or the way the team rallies behind Bargnani when he's playing his game giving the young rook from over seas the confidence he needs to know he's part of a team that's behind him.

Or maybe all that is just an after thought, a consequence&nbsp;of playing&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the best basketball this franchise has ever known,&nbsp;that when loosing to top teams&nbsp;everyone wonders how we let such games get away. But even more amazing is how quickly everyone has rallied behind a team when just last year the thought of being playoff bound and even possibly playoff contenders would have been laughed at by all serious sports analysts and writers. But whatever it is, its working, and its refreshing to see, lets just hope it carries on.
