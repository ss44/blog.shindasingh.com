        Now, if I was in town, I'd go just for the sake of going to see a tamashaa, (I remember Mata telling me how fun they were, back from his UFT days). Plus it gives you something to tell your kids about 20 years from now.</p>

          Not feeling the whole protest thing? Chul fer, <a href="http://www.gursikhijeevan.com/community/phorum/read.php?5,10213">go bowling</a> instead (only bibian allowed, if your a Singh then just go to Mugsy's and do something there) </div> </div> </div>
