_It's just a game._

_There's always next year._

_There are more important things in life._

All of these statements are true. Anyone with even a fraction of perspective realizes this. The sun came up today, and we are alive. It IS just a game. There IS always next year. There ARE more important things in life.

But none of these undeniable truths makes this any easier.

Why do we watch sports? What possesses a person to live and die by the actions of athletes who, for all intents and purposes, couldn't care less about our individual existence? Why do WE care SO much?

I don't have an answer for any of those questions. To an outsider, fans truly must seem like the root of their description: fanatics. After two decades, I no longer wrestle with my emotions. You love what you love. So, why do I care so much?

Maybe I have to. Life isn't always exactly a walk in the park. The kaleidoscope of emotions humans experience is legitimately dizzying. We need distractions sometimes, especially when the troughs are deeper than the peaks are high. The Toronto Maple Leafs have been my distraction for a long, long time. Days like yesterday remind me of the cruel irony: what will distract me from the Maple Leafs?

Look, if I sound dramatic, you will never understand. Only those who truly invest their emotions into their sports team can relate to what I felt late Monday night. No one needs to tell me how stupid that sounds, but this is my team and that's never going to change.

Leafs fans have taken abuse for the better part of nine years, which also doubles as the last time we made the playoffs. Sandwiched between a full season lost to collective bargaining, and another nearly wiped out this year, Leafs fans endured. Due to the enormous size of Leafs Nation, we are subject to legitimate hate from every other Canadian team in the NHL, and many other major markets in the United States. It isn't very logical, but fans of other teams feel as if we are to blame for Canada's love affair with the Leafs. Namely, the sports media in Canada. Every national sports highlight package begins and ends with news on the Leafs. It must be infuriating for other Canadian markets, and downright rage-inducing for those who have moved to Toronto from other provinces, where the coverage intensifies ten fold. Leafs fans gloat and troll no more or less than any other fan. We are just carrying the flag of a team haters love to hate.

I was still in high school when Jeremy Roenick came down the wing and blew a wrist shot past Belfour's glove and straight through my heart. Game six, eastern conference finals, overtime, sudden death. My friends and I sat staring blankly at the exuberant Flyers jumping for joy. I was blinking hard, and only occasionally, trying to will the score to change, for the game to live. 2000, 2002 and 2004 all ended in heart break, but I always felt like it was still the beginning of something great. My excitement was reignited a few weeks after the end of the 2004 season when I realized I now had all the time in the world to further invest in my beloved Maple Leafs. I was given a car by my amazing parents, and I had a decent part time job. Coupled with a dedicated group of friends, I figured the future held lots of playoff road trips and playoff tickets.

How wrong I was. The next nine years were a great reminder of a basic and necessary rule of life: never take anything for granted. Whether it's family, friends or life's simpler pleasures, nothing is guaranteed. We all grew up, to one degree or another. Although we were pulled in different directions by the journey, hockey and especially the Leafs kept us together. I have the same friends today that I did ten years ago.

So, why do I care so much? Because the Leafs aren't just some team, they are OUR team. The thrill of victory and agony of defeat can only be experienced truly, to their core, with the shared emotions of others.

    We were happy just to be there. Honest. After a nearly a decade, just being invited to the dance was enough. Everyone in Toronto literally forgot what it felt like to have the city drenched in blue and white: the distant buzz of car horns, the waving flags, the sense of hope.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Leafs were matched up against the Big Bad Bruins, a team that thoroughly embarrassed us for the past few years. 8-0 and 7-0 regular season wounds, salted with physical beat downs and unanswerable taunts. No one gave us a chance. The popular pick was the Bruins in 5, and after game 1, that seemed generous to the Leafs. My friends and I discussed briefly whether it was even worth it - climbing a hill to be rolled down the other side. We decided it was, that the experience alone would bear fruit in future seasons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then something unexpected and amazing happened. They started to skate, they started to hit and they started to believe. The thing about Toronto, as with any tortured sports town, is that we get behind our teams with unprecedented vigor when they show us they care as much as we do. Legends can be created overnight in the Stanley Cup playoffs, and the momentum was building. The Boston Bruins were two years removed from winning it all, and the last ten minutes of every game was a reminder to us and the world why they earned the moniker of champion. In hindsight, it was also an ominous foreshadow of what was coming. No lead felt safe and we only took a breath after the final buzzer filled the air with relief. Down 3-1 in the series, the inexperienced underdogs did the unthinkable and forced a game 7.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Game 7s are my favorite thing about sports. The guarantee of finality adds another level of emotional risk, and the adrenaline pumps freely. So here they were, and here we were, just happy to be there. Then, miraculously, it was 4-1 for the Leafs with about ten minutes left in the game. Statistically and historically speaking, the last ten minutes were a formality: no one comes back from three goals down. No seriously, in the history of the NHL, no team ever came back from three goalies down in game 7 of a playoff game.

    What you need to understand is that Leafs fans have decades of experience with failure and heart break. The Gretzky high stick will always be The One, but I can recall literally dozens of lesser incidences, and I'm not even 30 yet. Trauma, whether psychological, emotional or physical, is residual. When something or someone you love lets you down over and over again, your brain adapts and you begin to put up a guard. It's a defense mechanism to protect oneself.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Simply, we let our guard down. A nine year layoff coupled with a near statistical guarantee of victory allowed us to forget, just for a moment, that we were supporting the Toronto Maple Leafs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Everyone knows what happened next.

    An unprecedented, historical and legitimately soul-crushing collapse. "Not like this, man, not like this." It was akin to being offered your dream job, quitting your old one, buying a new car to celebrate, moving all your things into your new office and then being told the company is bankrupt and you've got to leave immediately. Except, it was worse. Just complete and utter devastation. I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I suspect the closest feeling is the overwhelming emptiness one must feel after losing someone close to them, shortly after being told they will survive. I'm not saying they are equal in their significance, because that is ridiculous. The emotional devastation, however, is comparable.

This feeling will pass. Life doesn't stand still for anyone and we will all have to move on at some point. Maybe the team will come back from this with a sense of singular purpose, a mission to prove that they can get up from even the biggest blow. Maybe they will never be the same again, their psyches permanently scarred by the pain of being blind sided with unprecedented heartbreak.

Whatever happens, I'll be right there with them.

**Go Leafs Go.**
