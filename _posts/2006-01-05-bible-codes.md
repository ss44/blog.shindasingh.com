I was coming back home late one night, and usually the talk radio stations got those next alien sci-fi shows which deal with paranormal / consperacy type topics. Much of this stuff is what most sane people consider trash, and parnoia.

The thing that they where talking about was the end of the world in August 2006. Now dont get me wrong I'm not pulling no Chicken little running around trying to concince anyone that the sky is falling, or nothing, but the speaker was talking about how that conclusion was based on Bible Codes.

Now this was my first time hearing about such a thing, and it obviosly sparked some curiosity. So as I always do when I'm curious I hit up google and searched Bible Codes and came across [this site](http://exodus2006.com/3code.htm). Now I have no idea what they are doing to establish or what system they are using to decipher these codes, and messages, and be honest I dont really care.

But lets imagine for a second that this stuff has some truth behind it. That the Bible contains some hidden prophecies and messages. COULD the same hold true for Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji? Now obvioslly anyone who cares to put enough effort into things can create some links to anything they want, or justifiy whatever they feel like, but I'm thinking about it more from a sense that if the Bible contains such hints, then surley Sahib Sri Guru Granth Sahib Jee, the greatest Granth ever composed has something similar, that is more accurate and percise??

But then again would that even matter? So what if somewhere in Sri Guru Granth Sahib Jee , Takhur Jee, tells us about future storms, wars, or plagues. How would any of that even effect us with our quest of obtaining mukhti? Would that not in fact take away from Mahraaj's greatness, with us believing less in the message of love and more about the hidden message of destruction?

So now reapplying the logic to the above, would that not in turn mean that, by looking for such codes and hidden messages in the Bible, we transform the essential message that is perscribed in its text? I.E do we not take away from the arth and make them secondary in comparison to the prohpecies?

For those of you wondering where I'm going with this, the answer is nowhere. I'm just thinking out loud, giving yall something to read and pass your time with. After all, if your reading this, your defnitlly wasting more time then me.
