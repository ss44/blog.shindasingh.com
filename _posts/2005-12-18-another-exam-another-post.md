Sitting up in the library with Tejdeep. He actually seems to be getting something done, where as I havn't been able to get through a thing yet. I know its bad, but what you going to do? Final exam is in the morning. Ahhh the pressure, and for once I'm out of things to do.

Last night I accidently deleted the Hukamnaama function (the code that displays the Hukamnaama from Darbaar Sahib on GursikhiJeevan). I was trying to shut down the computer when I kept clicking "yes" whenever the save changes bar came up. It was only until someone messaged me later that there was an error on the site that I realized what happened.

Oh well, luckily the function itself isn't to big, so took only a few minutes to recode, but I doubt this new one is refined as the last one, which I guess will prove itself true in the coming days when the Mukh vaaks have errors when they show up.

But then again what you going to do?

Chulloo, time to really get serious about this studying since I only got a few hours left.

Aaaakhooo Saat naam Sri Vahegurooo Jeee..
