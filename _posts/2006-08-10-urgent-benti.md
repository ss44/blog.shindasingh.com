Satkaar Yogh Sadh Sangat Jee,

Jasdeep Singh aka [Balzy](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=37 "The Capital Mob") aka [The Running Guy](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=239 "A False Alarm"), has recently emailed me in desperation of being lost and confused and in dire need of your guidance. Primarily if you are familiar with VIA Rail and Queens University. His desperate plea ensues:

  <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.75em">I agree that this wasn't urgent and that it is is totally wrong to draw attention in such a manour and am more then familiar with the story of the boy who called wolf. However, it has been a looong day at work, and I am now incredibly, incredibly tired, bored and a combination of all the above and still sitting here behind a desk, so therefore obstain any and all care for having written the above. As such, if you feel offended then I can offer you little to no condolence to this fact, but would greatly insist on an apology on your behalf for offending me with your inability of letting things slide. If you feel this post was incredibly stupid and are frustrated even more by the fact that you have read this far, and have eyes that hurt from having to squint to read this portion of the post then I humbly offer you <a href="http://piv.pivpiv.dk/">this website</a> which I feel will much better pass your time and describes my provibial opinion of you at this time. Thank You.</span>
