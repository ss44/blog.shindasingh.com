The playoffs officially get underway today, and lucky for me I'm only 2 exams away from actually being able to enjoy them. So as always its time to make my picks and here's how I see it. Feel free to add your own in the comments, and we'll see how close we are.

<p align="center">
  <strong>West Coast<br /> </strong>San Antonio Vs Sacramento - <em>San Antonio<br /> </em>Dallas Vs Memphis - <em>Dallas<br /> </em>Denver VS LA Clipers - <em>LA Clippers<br /> </em>Phoenix vs LA Lakers - <em>Phoenix</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <strong>East Coast</strong><br /> Detroit Vs Milwaukee - <em>Detroit</em><br /> Cleveland Vs Washington - <em>Cleveland</em><br /> New Jersey Vs Indiana - <em>New Jersey</em><br /> Miami Vs Chicago - <em>Miami</em>
</p>

  No major surprises here. The Phoenix series should be the most fun to watch, and I wouldn't put it pass Kobe to pull a game or two out of his back pocket, but I think he used up all his miracles by getting the Lakers this far. On the East, I'm going with the underdogs (Cleveland) who have a 1-3 record against Washington. Hopefully Lebron will be able to step it up big, and not disappoint.
