It's been a while since I left Western, and even while I was their I kept as low a profile as is expected, but that could have had more to do with the fact that I spent 90% of my days asleep (I think I was sleeping roughly 12, 13 hours a day back then).Anyways, first I thought I'd give a shout out to the [Western SSA](http://www.westernssa.com/), who seems to have things on lock, but more importantly I thought Id reflect on my days at Western or at least the year I spent doing nothing.

Actually why not talk about the one thing that I did look forward to, Mata bringing back muffins that his mom made for _us_ every other weekend. These were probably by far the greatest tasting muffins I ever had and I think anyone who lived in that house on Sunpac (the one with the Nishaan Sahib, up outside) would agree, that they where the one thing that everyone looked forward to. Well maybe me more so then anyone else, considering I would raid them and they would be gone within the first 2 days. They where awesome, chocolate chip muffins to die for, and then there was also the cake, but that was usually all gone an hour upon arrival.

      Above, Mata after his Dastar Bandhi. The Sangat appointed him Jatehdar for his countless hours of langar dee sevaa, and Kirtan.

      Then of course there where the pranks, that we pulled, those were in a league of their own. Such pranks included:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Turning off the water supply when others where in the shower, (never was on the receiving end of this).
      </li>
      <li>
        Piling and stacking up the entire kitchens furniture (fridge, stove, table, punday, chairs) all in front of Amrits door, while he was asleep at night.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hiding and scaring the life out of Baba (hed always grab his chest and be a heart beat away from having a full blown heart attack), by hiding in his room then popping out when he least expected it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Putting Polmolive on anything and everything in the basement. This included but was not limited to, door knobs, door handles (fridge, stove, microwave), toilet seats, and off course but not least all the faucets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Locking the downstairs guys out from the top half of the house. In retaliation they shut off our power, disconnected our Cable, and turned off our water supply. Luckily we where able to plug the fridge into a socket that was wired with an outlet from downstairs, so it stayed on and no food got spoiled We were also quick to react , whenever they turned the water back on for themselves and quickly filled up any patila we had with water.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      There were probably a half dozen others, that I cant remember or dont want to remember just because of the psychological scars they probably left, which forced me to subdue them to the nether regions of my subconscious.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then of course there were Matas <em>jam sessions. </em>Even without a tabla player hed go on doing keertan well into the night and the times that he had one, well that caused for the one kirtani rainsavhi. Literally, hed start at 8 or 9 at night, and would go on until about 3, 4 in the morning). Recordings were made, but I doubt youll be seeing them on any site anytime soon.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I could probably go on with other stories such as the time we went <a href="http://www.westernssa.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=5">Paintballing</a>, and Baba bailed on me, leaving me to hold my own against the entire opposing team, or the mission where Mata used me as his human shield, but then I wouldnt have stories to share in person, so left that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I would have included pictures, but considering all of us were broke none of us had one back then, except for that one night when had one and ended up taking a bunch of pictures and making that Sikh pioneer video, trailer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Maybe Ill put that up, one of these days, but then again maybe I shouldnt, or <em>should I?</em>
