Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, people of all ages, it is official, Shinda Singhs popping out his own blog, with even more useless thoughts then my msn space, maybe not near as controversial since this is now public, but all the same, I bring to you, my loyal fans in attendance and the millions around the world, Shindas BLOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..

So now while you retie your keskis, lets jump into todays hot topic, which is (drum roll)...

Last Nights Apprentice..

If you havn't watched it read no further. That means stop HERE. Otherwise lets talk about Randell winning ;). From the early start after watching Randell perform he was the clear choice, he just dominated. I know many of us where left upset since Season 1, when Kwami lost out to Bill, in what clearly appeared to be corporate Sabotage, (why Kwami? WHY did you choose Amorosa??) , and instantly the race card was thrown up.

Well this time originally I didn't figure in the race card, until after I hit up the tv.com [apprentice forums](http://www.tv.com/the-apprentice/show/20528/forums.html&fpage=show_messages.php&board=9565&topic=170299&page=0) and saw the main thread talking about it.

From the very second Randel made his choice I was pretty shocked. Just because Randel seemed well relaxed, and he has that attitude where as long as things are doing good, why not, shrug of the shoulders laid back style.

So second he blasted on Trump for hiring more then one Apprenteice i was like....(this is public now no cursing)... Main reason I was shocked is because the hiring of both people seemed like the obvious thing for Trump. Both candidates where Super stars in there own rights, and with all the multiple firings this season you'd figure Trump would match that up with a a double hiring.

So was there something more sinister going on in the shadows? Who's to really say, I personally didn't make much of it, but one post which really got me thinking or at least swaying that oppinion was the one from the forum that read,

> Only in america can a black hold five serious education degrees, own five business and completely run circles around a less experience, less educated white women and still be asked to "share" his victory.

So was Trump jonzed to hire Rebecca over Randel, just didn't have it in him, or was this just part of the show? My Answer: Who cares, its TV, there not hooking me up with none of the profits, so they could both have been fired and I'd have still thought the episode was just as good..

Woooo My first post is done.....

This could be the start of a beuatiful relationship. (If only there was spell check that is)
