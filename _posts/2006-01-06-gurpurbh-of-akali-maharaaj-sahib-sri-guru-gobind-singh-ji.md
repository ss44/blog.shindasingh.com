So while surfing the net I came across [this article](http://www.panthic.org/news/132/ARTICLE/2125/2006-01-01.html) on [Panthic Weekly](http://www.panthicweekly.com), where the author writes,

> "During this period of depression, pakhandi (fake) Sants, Bab√©, and people claiming to be the Guru appeared. The groups which at one time were suppressed or remained quiet during the time of the Jhajaroo Singhs, such as the Radha Soami and Naqli Nirankari, were now flourishing and opening Deras throughout Punjab misling and leading people away from Guru Granth Sahibji & Guru Panth."

As most people are aware during Guru Gobind Singh Ji's time a group of Masaansds (preachers), who were sent to preach Sikhi, went astary and started to promote themselves instead. They misled Sangat, used the money that was given for the use of the Panth for their own egos and needs. Upon learning of these actions Guru Gobind Singh Ji at once called for them, and threw each one into fire, banishing them to narkh (hell).

In the same way during this depression, Jhajaroo's took the form of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and blessed with his teer went out to remove the enemies of the Panth.

Now the author talks about a depression, and lists the ailments, which exist still today, leaving to reason that the Sikh kaum is still in a deep state of depression. Now no doubt the Panth has suffered great losses, but these are nothing compared to the losses we have suffered in the past. The author also implies that we have gone soft and become feeble, again something I would disagree to.

For one the world we now live in has changed. The enemy has changed his tactics and as such we have changed ours. In the 80's a majority of the Sikhs in India came from Punjab, and many lived simple lives. The government figured it would be a simple task to exterminate our brothers but instead recieved an unprecidented resistance, a resistance so strong, that it caused the Goverment losses it had never expected let alone accounted for.

So as always the Government needed a new plan of action. Instead of fighting us, they in turn started to study us, and gave us the one thing that all Sikhs wanted, guidance. They gave up War with arms and joined the world revolution and started a new war with the pen. Making subtle changes to the way we think, making us over react to counter their moves. We are now engaged in a war of mind games. A time in which the pen is mightier then the sword, and as such the Jhajaroo's of yesterday have put the saftey back on there guns, and now are seen carrying text books. Becoming professionals outside and inside India.

This doesn't mean Singhs are no longer ready to fight with arms, after all there have been many attempts on the lives of Ashotoush and Paniarwale. It just means that we have now accepted that in the grand scheme of things there is a smarter way to go about doing things. We have become more diplomatic, and more visible around the world, so much so that if 84 was to happen again, the world would raise its eyebrow, since we would be shouting into its (the worlds) ears to look at whats happening.

Now how does this all relate again to the evil Masaands that Guru Gobind Singh Ji sentanced to narkh? Back then the Sangat was taken for a ride, and many jumped on the band wagon of these Masaands, just like they are doing these days. Their was also Sangat out there that new better as there is today, and that took action, as we are taking action today. Some may feel its not being taken fast enough but its being taken. After all Rome wasn't built in a day, and no medicine cures the flu over night.

So as the onslaught of propaganda continues, lets not worry or even think that we are loosing. Instead continue to excel as we are doing, and at all times beg that Guru Sahib not let us go astray.

Aaaaaaaaaaaakhoo Sat Naam Sri Vaaaaaaaheguroooo Jeee..
