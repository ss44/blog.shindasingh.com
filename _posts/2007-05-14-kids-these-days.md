You would think that after everyone had the _R.I.P Kaka_ name tags in all there cyber profiles, and after those highly hyped stop the violence meetings at the Gurdwara's that it be at least a year before folks started rushing out trying to kill one another again, but seems like the tempers and ego's just couldn't wait.,

I guess what's most annoying about all this is that it's easy to see in hindsight how quickly this could have been anyone from my own generation or own circle of friends from highschool, considering the ego's back then were just as big as the kids these days, but seems like these kids all got an extra chip on there shoulder for some reason. As if they really have something to prove to the elders and past generations that they're just as rugged if not more then them. Maybe they're tired of hearing about the glory day's of the senior crews, the PM's, CB4's, Saraba's, BBS's, the Rexdale-Malton beefs of past, or whoever else you may have that came before them and done something so regrettably stupid but made it out alive, that the story later became suburban street folk-lore, setting a standard they feel they need to live up to. 

In the end who knows what's being put in the food of these kids to make them feel so ghetto fabulous, or what hannibal-istic ingredient is being added to their cheerios and fruit loops, infecting them with some next form of mad cow diesease. 

And as parents go running looking for the answer, screaming to the giani's and other youth leaders, blaming them for not being able to rescue there lost child, asking why couldn't they have gone out of there way to highlight the symptoms and save _their blood_, one can only wonder what lessons the others may have learned, after all the lesson itself always remains embodied within the action.

> 
> "You could see his hand was up with some kind of weapon in his hand, whatever it was, ready for battle, preparing himself, like, \`bring it on,'" he said. "It all happened pretty fast." Police said the brawl was triggered by a long-simmering dispute among some of the partygoers.
> 
> "It was something about, **\`You didn't like me in Grade 10,'"** said Voth.
> 
> "It's not a good scene," he said, gazing across a street criss-crossed with yellow police tape. "I've only been here two years and now I'm ready to go a little further north into the country, do some home-schooling with my kids and make sure they're safe."
> 
> His wife Samantha also said they may move from the neighbourhood constructed just six years ago.

> 
> But she doesn't know where they'll go next to escape violence. "It's everywhere," she said. "My daughter was in tears, crying her eyes out. They asked me if anybody died. I'm not going to lie to them," she said. "You don't want to have to explain that to any child."
> 
> Snelgrove watched as teens tried to perform cardio-pulmonary resuscitation on Atwal. "But by that time it looked like it was too late," she said.
> 
> Peel police said yesterday they hadn't found the knife used to kill Atwal.
