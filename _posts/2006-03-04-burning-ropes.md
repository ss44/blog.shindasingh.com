So you got two ropes, both having different lenghts.
  
If you light either rope, in exactly 1 hour the rope will be fully burned/consumed.
  
The ropes are not the same length or thickness.
  
Also the rate at which the rope burns isn't uniform. (It may burn faster then slower then faster), so if half the rope is half burned that doesn't mean that half an hour has gone by.

Using the two ropes how do you measure that 45 minutes worth of time has gone by?
