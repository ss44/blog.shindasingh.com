      Yes folks, it's that time of year again. Yudh is back once more and this year it promises to be a bigger event then the ones before it. Simple reason being more competitors from more places = bigger tournament. This year there's&nbsp;competitors coming from all over Canada, and the States and even India. I think a big thing is the&nbsp;under 16 competition which made entering possible for those who&nbsp;normally wouldn't be able to.&nbsp;

      For those who've never heard of Yudh before, its the annual North American Gatka competition that takes place in Toronto every year. Fighters compete against each other in a round robin style tourney. Every year Yudh has gotten a little bigger and a lot better so hopefully this year will not be any different.
