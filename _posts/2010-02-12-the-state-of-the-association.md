It's been a while since I wrote anything about the NBA and what better time to change that then at the All-Star break. To start off with, let me give you my award winners so far this season.

**Coach of the Year**: Larry Brown, Charlotte Bobcats

Larry Brown has done it again and has the Bobcats in line for their first ever playoff birth. No one expected this team to be in the hunt or be as good as they are on home court but Larry Brown has them playing defense at a very high level and executing very well down the stretch.

Honourable Mention: Scott Brooks, OKC Thunder. Lionel Hollins, Memphis Grizzlies. Rick Adelman, Houston Rockets.

**Sixth Man of the Year:** Jamal Crawford, Atlanta Hawks

Crawford finally got a chance to play for a winning team for the first time in his life and he has not disappointed. Coming off the bench he is dropping almost 18points/game. He makes a lot of clutch shots for the Hawks and has helped them to a 3rd seed in the East and a season sweep of the Boston Celtics.

Honourable Mention: Carl Landry, Houston Rockets

**Most Improved Player:** Carl Landry, Houston Rockets

Landry has been coming off the bench and dominating fourth quarters this year and almost has the Rockets in the playoffs with a bunch of nobodies.

Honourable Mention: Josh Smith, Atlanta Hawks (He just learned to use his brain this year). Marc Gasol, Memphis Grizzles (Rookie to Sophomore jump).

**Rookie of the Year:** Brandon Jennings, Milwaukee Bucks

He is one of the reasons that the Bucks are almost in the Playoffs. Plus, it doesn't hurt if you drop 55points in a game. Just because a rookie doesn't lead all rookies in scoring doesn't mean he ain't the best. It's always easy to put up a lot of numbers on bad teams (Tyreke Evans).

Honourable Mention: Tyreke Evans, Sacramento Kings

**Executive of the Year:** Sam Presti, OKC Thunder

I know you can't technically give this award until the end of the season but you have to reward Same Presti for putting this Thunder team together through trades, free agent signings and really good draft picks. It looks like the Thunder will make the playoffs this year and will contend in the years to come.

**Defensive Player of the Year:** Gerald "Crash" Wallace, Charlotte Bobcats

Crash is a beast on the boards from the 3 position and his on the ball defence is as good as it has always been. Him and Stephen Jax finally have the Bobcats in the position to make the playoffs and Crash has finally been awarded by being selected as an All-Star.

Honourable Mention: Dwight Howard, Orlando Magic. Josh Smith, Atlanta Hawks

**Most Valuable Player:** LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers

I don't think anyone else, with the exception of maybe one or two players, means as much to his team as LeBron does. He dominates games and if he doesn't put up a minimum of 25-5-5 his team does not have a chance of winning. LeBron is the Cleveland Cavaliers. Without him they are nothing. He is carrying that entire team plus Shaq's 350lb corpse on his back and has them in 1st place in the Association.

Honourable Mention: Kobe Bryant, LA Lakers. Kevin Durant-ula, OKC Thunder.

Obviously many people will disagree with my opinions so feel free drop a line and I'll explain my choices further if need be.

Now moving onto All-Star Weekend in Dallas, Texas. To start off with, let me just state who I think should have been on the teams. Note: I'm not taking any injuries or anything into consideration.

**Eastern Conference**

**Starters:
  
** 

G - Rajon Rondo
  
G - Dwayne Wade
  
F - LeBron James
  
F - Chris Bosh
  
C - Dwight Howard

**Reserves:**

Al Horford
  
Josh Smith
  
Gerald Wallace
  
Derrick Rose
  
Paul Pierce
  
Joe Johnson
  
Joakin Noah
  
David Lee

I was very, very hesitant to give David Lee an All-Star spot because his team got spanked by 50 points but he's put up some serious numbers. Not only that, he does everything he can to keep his team in every game and has become a much better player this year. So that's right, AI and KG, they are NOT All-Stars.

**Western Conference**

**Starters:**

G - Chris Paul
  
G - Kobe Bryant
  
F - Carmelo Anthony
  
F - Dirk Nowitzki
  
C - Tim Duncan (He's a C, not a PF. Let's get real.)

**Reserves:**

Steve Nash
  
Andrew Bynum
  
Kevin Durant
  
Zach Randolph
  
Brandon Roy
  
Deron Williams
  
Chauncey Billups

Pau Gasol missed too many games to be an All-Star. Also, the Rockets don't have an All-Star because they are a team in every sense of the word.

**All-Star Events**

Good news about the All-Star events this year. All of the events will be televised up here in Canada.

**Celebrity Game -** Friday, 7pm on Raptors NBA TV

I'm gonna go with the team that has Terrell Owens, Chris Tucker and Rick Fox over a team that has Mark Cuban, Robert Horry and is coached by Magic Johnson.

**Rookie Challenge -** Friday, 9pm on TSN2

I got the Sophomores winning this over the Rookies. They just have too much talent to lose to a bunch of Rookies. However, Brandon Jennigs and his high top as well as Stephen Curry will put on a show for the Rookies.

**Dunk In -** Friday, Halftime of Rookie Challenge Game

Demar DeRozan or DDR or DD will beat out Eric Gordon in the Dunk in, with ease. Gordon didn't even wanna be in this thing.

**Horse -** Saturday, 7pm on TSN2

Kevin Durant will successfully defend his HORSE title over Rajon Rondo and Omri Casspi.

**All-Star Saturday Night**- Starts 8pm on TSN2

**Haier Shooting Stars:** 

**Team Texas** (Dirk, Kenny & Becky Hammon) will beat out Team Atlanta (Joe Johnson, Steve Smith & Angel McCoughtry), Team LA (Pau, Breant Barry & Marie Ferdinand-Harris) and Team Sacramento (Tyreke Evans, Chris Webber & Nicole Powell).

**Skills Challenge:**

Brandon Jennings
  
Steve Nash
  
Derrick Rose
  
Deron Williams

I got **Deron Williams** winning this since he's gonna give it his all in his hometown. The Rook - Brandon Jennings - will be in the final with him but Deron will put on a show for his family and friends.

**Three-Point Contest:**

Chauncey Billups
  
Daequan Cook - Defending Champ
  
Stephen Curry
  
Channing Frye
  
Danilo Gallinari
  
Paul Pierce

I got the baby face assassin **Stephen Curry** taking this 3 point shootout. He's coming off a triple double in which he dropped 36 points. Danilo Gallinari will meet him in the Final.

**Dunk Contest:**

Gerald Wallace
  
Shannon Brown
  
Nate Robinson
  
DeMar DeRozan - Will win Dunk-In

I got **Shannon Brown** taking this one home back to LA. As good as all the other dunkers are, Shannon Brown has some freakish athleticism and huge hands.

**All-Star Game -** Sunday, 7pm on TSN

The **East** will win this game in front of 90 000+ fans. As for the MVP, it's going to be hometown boy **Chris Bosh** taking it home.

Alright, that's enough for now. Holla back.
