I wouldn't say I tie an under pugh made of tin foil but sometimes the moves are so out in the open that you can't help but to see what's to coming five moves in advance.

What happened on Saturday was a victory, but not one to be celebrated by those who feel the mahantaa of Dasam Guru di baani. Rather one for those who wish to see the Sikh faith saturated and flushed out of the main stream. The irony lies in the fact that those protesting felt that their protests where in defiance of the delusion of Sikhi but this very group only helped further trigger that very cause.

There's been little doubt that external forces have been trying to crush Sikhs from within, creating issues from non issues stirring up heated and emotional debates while gouging at scars that they've known would trigger a response. This started a few years back with the complete revival of looking at the Sikhs and particularly the Nagar Kirtans. Portraying us as revengeful terrorist loving extremists who all want nothing more then to see the death of every Hindu. They tried to make us feel ashamed for honouring our Shaheeds on floats, and in our Gurdwaray. Those who fell victim to this self hate would publicly question what the point of honouring our Shaheeds really is, these questions would then garner emotional responses of disrespect and outrage. No one willing to talk or educate but rather yell and humiliate those who dared have an inkling of disrespect.

Then, there was the Dasam issue. They started hurling insults, calling it "kanjar bani", they'd sit on forums, create websites and send countless emails, challenging people to debates on the radio if they dared. Most times these debates would end in them reading from notes that they google'd and these internet scholars would later resort to plain old name calling. They'd master how to play the victim role if anyone ever dared incite any emotional response, carefully painting the other side as uneducated, power hungry monsters, fearful of losing control. In the community, they lifted themselves to a new platform of self riotousness.

They stole plays right out of the playbook of the Glenn Backs, and Bill O Riley's. They'd question, for the sake of questioning no matter how absurd the question itself really was. They'd incite, and agitate knowing full well that any means of suppressing their questions would only further enhance their stand of being innocent in the mix of things. They ignored the responses, side stepped the rebuttals  only asking the questions louder each time drowning out any rational debate.

They poked the dog, knowing very well that sooner or later it would bite, they were counting on it. Forcing the dog to finally give in and just snap, so that they could then point  and say "See told you that they're dangerous." Then demand that the dog be put to sleep, for everyones safety. The thing is, none of this was overly clever, or intrinsically  planned It was all out there in the open and by our very nature we got played, and took the bait.  We succumbed to what they wanted and became the very dogs that they were painting us out to be.

This is why we can't give in to their games. Nor is it reason for us to ever stoop to there level and try to play it against them. Instead this is a time when we need to own up for our own mistakes, admit where we were wrong and put focus back on where focus needs to be. The good that the community has done over the years.

There's a reason people don't talk about the good, its because we ourselves don't. We often applaud it from afar and move on. Sometimes out of jealousy we ourselves resent it and try to ignore it feeling that there's no reason to focus to much on it,  whether out of humility or jealousy the results remain the same, by not telling our story and being in control of it, we leave it for others to tell.

Now more then ever the community needs to be pre-emptive in highlighting the good, not so we can cover up the bad, we need to always remain honest and truthful in acknowledging our faults, but more importantly so that we can present our side of the story. Let the world know who we really are, and not let the media paint us with a single stroked brush. Show that like every community amongst the minute of "bad", there exists even more good, and that we ourselves are mature, well and capable of rooting out such evils.

See we may have been put in a corner, but not without an exit, and that unless this is a game we want to lose, maybe its time to make the right move.
