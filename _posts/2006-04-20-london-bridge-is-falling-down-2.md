Need a study break? Check the following clip out from an improv comedy show thats reminicint of, _Who's Line Is It Anyways,_ just with a hip hop twist.

Basically the teams took two nursary rhymes and remixed them into Hip Hop joints. The first team is whatever, but thanks to Lil John the other teams rendition of London Bridge is too funny to pass up.

Note-UK readers may be offended, but shows from the States, not Canada, so hate them not us.
