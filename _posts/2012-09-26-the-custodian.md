A friend of mine passed away the other day, you probably never heard of him. He probably would have wanted it that way.

I met him in grade 10. Him and some older Singh’s used to run basketball at Kipling Collegiate and a few of them had invited some of us to come play with them. Kipling changed to Humberview but the man paying the bills and unlocking the doors remained the same.

For most of us, that was our introduction to him. The Singh who paid for basketball and made sure we always got our runs in. If he saw you quietly sitting in the corner too shy or timid to ask for next, he would throw you on a team, no matter how bad you were and made sure you got to touch the ball every now and then. He had little patience for bullies, so in his gym everyone got equal time.

I didn't realize until much later how much time and effort he must have put into organizing tournaments and getting gym time. He was never one to brag and seldom did people realize he organized these events. That's how he liked it. He considered any type of attention to be almost embarrassing and any type of praise to be wasteful.

I was fortunate enough to see him a few weeks back. At that time he told me about the insecurities and uneasiness he felt throughout school, how self-conscious he was of being a Singh and having that saroop and being singled out for it. How un-justly uncomfortable he at times would feel for just being himself and how he wanted to make sure that no one else had to feel that way.

It was those feelings that motivated him to try and make sure none of the up-coming generations had to face that kind of thing, so he opened up the doors and invited us youngin's every Friday night to play basketball and just hang out with the older dudes, to just be around them. As they moved on, another generation moved in and now we were the ones setting the examples, offering up advice and cracking jokes.

The whole time thinking we were there to just play basketball, while his goals extended well beyond the court. Where the young would gather with those just a few years ahead; he provided that venue to hang out informally, approach those who may have seemed un-approachable and have an opportunity to learn, talk and grow. One could see it as a silent mentorship -- giving that one quiet kid in the corner someone he could talk to, in between runs, to offer him advice on the most trivial of things, instilling doses of confidence in them and an appreciation for who they are.

Even 15 years later, a lot of the stories we share come from moments that he helped orchestrate. Most people I know today come from those circles he helped. While he'll be missed he will be far from forgotten and the lives he touched will hopefully transcend in helping others. There comes talk of OG's those who were the originals, as far as the GTA goes, he was definitely one of those dudes who helped clear a path for the rest of us.

To his family and closest of friends, I can only offer you my condolences and hope for you all to find peace and strength in his passing. Know that he was loved. All the time he put into helping us become better people will always be remembered and appreciated.

More than anything I hope, that “we” can pick up and continue to do what he did and continue to help instill the confidence and courage in just being unique and being ourselves the same way he helped instill those values in us. Even if it is simply just by making sure the doors are open and everyone gets a run.[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1186" title="harp" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harp.png" alt="" width="350" height="350" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harp.png 350w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harp-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harp-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harp.png)
