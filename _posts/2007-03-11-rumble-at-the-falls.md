The following video contains strong language and is not suitable for those who are quickly offended, (especially by vulgarity).

All the same I thought this video was too funny to pass up on, mans getting into it at Niagara Falls in front of everyone, the only real tourist attraction in the Toronto area. Its nothing new, but its hilarious all the same, then again not all of you will share in the sense of humor so do consider yourself warned.
