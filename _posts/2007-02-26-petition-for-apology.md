Was sent this link courtesy of Umpa and also found it on [Garth Turners](http://www.garth.ca/weblog/2007/02/26/navdeep-bains/) blog as being the official, "We want Stephen Harper to apologize to Navdeep Bains" [petition](http://www.garth.ca/weblog/2007/02/26/navdeep-bains/).

Last time Navdeep asked for an apology the PM basically danced around the issue saying all he did was quote an article from a newspaper, and if Nav's got any beef he should take it up with Kim Bolan and the Vancouver Sun, in other words, _"don't shoot the messenger."_

Even though I don't see or believe that the petition&nbsp;will get the PM to change his mind anytime soon, but the fact that you're reading this means you have nothing better to do anyways so just sign the damn thing!
