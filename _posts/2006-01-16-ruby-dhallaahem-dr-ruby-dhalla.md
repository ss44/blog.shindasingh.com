For one reason or another I've never been a big fan of Dr. Ruby Dhalla. Never really, known her, heard her, let alone seen her, so me not being a fan of her is pretty shallow and really judgmental.

Firstly she didn't complete no PHD, or Med school, she's a chiropractor, so I personally don't think that the "Dr." prefix is warranted. She's also been plagued throughout her campaign with scandals, if it hasn't been for being a bollywood actress, its for being a phone sex operator, to what ever else you can imagine. Whether or not these rumors have any truth to them, I guess we (the public) will never truly know.

[<img width="226" height="169" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/107864-42551-752032.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/107864-42551-758350.jpg)To her credit though Miss Dhalla probably has some of the best potential to rise up in ranks with the party, since she is young and well versed in English and from what last I heard was learning her French. However this campaign she faces off against Sam Hundal, a pretty well known personality within the community, so the desi vote will automatically be split. On top of that Ruby voted for Same Sex Marriage, and as a result is a victim of not being able to speak at certain Gurdwara's and will have certain Sangat members voting against her, tipping what I would call the desi vote into Sam's favour.

On top of all that that the Liberals are down in the polls by 10 points, meaning that the general census and public is leaning more towards the Conservatives, another factor working against Miss Dhalla.

So with all that working against her, Miss Dhalla has the odds stacked up against her. I personally don't see her making it through this campaign on top, and so my favourite for this riding would have to be Mr. Sam Hundal.
