Reasons to get Mandeep into Brampton City Hall

  1. **Sports**. If you play hockey, basketball, football, baseball then you must vote Mandeep. He will make sure you get the parks, the rec centers that Springdale and Castlemore so desperatly need so that you can go out and play, compete and have fun.
  2. **Libraries**. Not all of us are athletes. Some of us like to read, other things besides this blog. For that you can always go online, but when you feel like reading something worth reading you need to goto the library, and this my friends is where Mandeep Dhaliwal thats right MANDEEP DHALIWAL will help you. He will work hard at opening a REAL library not the excuse for one that they got on the corner of the Fortino's plaza, a REAL library the type that those folks from Brampton South enjoy, the same type that those in Bramlea enjoy, a library better then 4 corners, that my friends is what Mandeep Dhaliwal will work hard at getting for YOU.
  3. **Say no to Nukes**. Mandeeps against Nuclear Radiation in our backyard, he's against accidents or the risk of them happening. He's against us going to Jot Parkash matha teking and worrying about potentially harmful chemicals and radiation waves coming from the proposed nuclear incinerator down the street Mandeeps against the opening of a Nuclear Incernator in Wards 9 & 10, so voting for him is a vote for a clean environment, a radiation free environment, its a vote in the right direction. <div style="text-align: center">

  4. **Respect.** Mandeep was raised to respect his elders, a trait that seems long gone amongst our youth today. Mandeep WILL work hard to make sure the seniors of Wards 9 & 10, don't share the neglected fait of the elders in Malton, who are left with no options but to sit around in Westwood mall. Mandeep will work to get them the community centers the drop in centers the clinics, whatever they need Mandeep is there for them. WHY!?!? Because Mandeep respects his elders Mandeep loves his elders, its the elders who help shape tomorrows leaders, Mandeep knows that and he respects that, and he will work to prove that to you!

Now I could go on I could list you a million other reasons why Mandeep deserves to be in city council. Hes worked in the community. He's worked for the community. He knows the community. That my friends is why Mandeep deserves to represent the community.

So make sure come November, that you do whats right, whats needed and vote Mandeep Dhaliwal. None of the others, will do what Mandeep can do. Mandeep can read write and speak English, Punjabi, Hindi, Patwa, the others might try, but they're not Mandeep. So vote genuine, vote the truth vote with whats right, vote MANDEEP DHALWAIL for your City Councillor Wards 9 & 10 to represent the diversity that is our community.
