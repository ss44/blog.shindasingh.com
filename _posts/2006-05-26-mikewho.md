[audio:SLAMradio_MikeJames.mp3] Mike James...who? my point exactly. Who does this guy think he is? Future NBA All Star? MVP?? You have to hate the fact that players such as Mike James come onto the Raptors have a decent season because they get to hog the ball and then blame the game on the young'ins (Bosh & Charlie V), and now he thinks he can get away with choosing his team, calling himself the greatest, etc. etc.</p> 

At least when Tyson went crazy, you could still reflect on Tyson's golden years, but with Mike James this guy's just plain arrogant. Get rid of him, and let him become another shadow in the dusk, joining the ranks of Rafer Alston and others whose names have been permanently etched out of my memory.
