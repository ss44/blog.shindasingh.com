I was procrastinating as usual and so I was going through some sites and came across the following tukh from Sri Dasam Granth Sahib:

<div>
  <div align="center">
    ??????? ?????? ???????? ??????? ????? ??????? ? ??????? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????? ????
  </div>
  
  <div align="center">
    <em> The friendship of a queer type will wash and destroy the sanctity of friendship; the friends and enemies will go together for their self-interest.26.</em>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    (Rest of the Shabad can be read <a href="http://www.sridasam.org/dasam?Action=Page&p=1135">here</a>)
  </div>
  
  <div>
    It be nice if that tukh was enough to end the whole gay sikh debate, but sadly enough it'll probably only get more people to reject Bani from Sri Dasam Granth.Anyhow, check out the Shabad, pretty interesting considering the way Guru Sahib describes the depth and details of Kaljug, seems like many of those things have come to pass, or are passing.</p>

      Also the tukhs on religion and lack of it in people and the whole Gurudom's popping up every 4 days, reminded me a lot about India, and current rate that Sants and Nakli Guru's are popping up.
