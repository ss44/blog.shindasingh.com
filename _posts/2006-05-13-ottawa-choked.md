Looks like Ottawa choked once again, and this year it didnt even take the Leafs to bring them to their knees.

I could go on, but I think I've said more then enough. I'd also like to take this moment to dedicate this post to the entire Ottawa fam' who spent the entire year trying to convince me on Ottawas greatness, (pshh so great they lost the series in 5..)

Now I could go on, but I think the truth and the reality of things speaks for itself.

- PS I look forward to your excuses.
