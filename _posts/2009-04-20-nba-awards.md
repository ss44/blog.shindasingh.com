It's that time of the year again. I said year, not month so all the women can stop reading from this point on. I'm joking, for those of you who enjoy the NBA, please read on. And don't let my words rile you up because then you're just giving in to me. Stay strong.

Now back to the business at hand. The regular season is over and it's time to hand out the NBA Awards. The committee of one, myself, did have some tough decisions to make this year but in the end I think I made the right ones so lets get it on.

**MVP -** LeBron James, Cleveland

I said all along that whoever finished with a better record between LeBron James and Kobe Bryant should deserve to be the MVP and LeBron made sure his team did not let up down the stretch. The Cavs only had one loss at home all season long (I'm not counting the last game of the season) and that is astounding in it's own right.

Honourable Mention: Kobe Bryant, Lakers. Chanuncy Billups, Nuggets. Chris Paul, Hornets. Dwight Howard, Magic. Dwayne Wade, Heat.

**Coach of the Year:** Nate McMillan, Portland

For me, this award came down to either McMillan or Adleman of the Rockets. The Blazers are a really, really young team and to finsih with home court in the first round in the Western Conference is a feat on its own. Mike Brown may have the best record in the leauge but let's face it, we expected the Cavaliers to finish either 1st or 2nd in the East and same with Phil Jackson and his Lakers. No one expected the Blazers to finish in 4th in the West and McMillan did a good job keeping the team competitive throughout the season. Adleman was a close second because of the soap opera that was the Rockets this year. Through it all, he kept the Rockets competitive and made sure they didn't let down. I thought about giving it to George Karl as well but we all know that team changed because of Billups.

And I still can't believe Jerry Solan hasn't won this award ever.

Honourable Mention: Stan Van Gundy, Magic.

**ROY**: OJ Mayo, Grizzlies & Derrick Rose, Bulls

I'm going old school with my Rookie of the Year picks. Just like they did it with Kidd & Hill, it had to be done this year as well. Mayo put up serious numbers for the Grizzlies. It's not his fault he was on a bad team but he did everything he could have to make that team win the few games it did. Rose had a really good set of players around him and he made the most of it. Each of these players did what they were asked to do and I can't pick one more than the other.

Honourable Mention: Rudy Fernandez, Portland

**Defensive Player of the Year**: Dwight Howard, Orlando

This was a no brainer. By far the most dominant defensive big man in the game today. His presence alone deters teams from entering the paint. Led the league in both rebounds and blocked shots. He should have many of these before his career is over.

Honourable Mentions: LeBron James, Cleveland. Dwayne Wade, Miami. Ron Artest, Houston.

**Sixth Man:** Jason Terry, Dallas

This was a two man race between Terry and JR Smith with Lamar Odom being a distant third. Terry was an explosive force for the Mavericks all season long from the bench and he did what his team asked him to do. J R Smith put together a nice run down the stretch but Terry did it all year long.

Honourable Mentions: Smith, Denver. Lamar Odom, Lakers.

**Most Improved:** Chris "the Birdman" Anderson, Denver

A year ago he was just coming back into the NBA after his hiatus due to a drug suspension. This year he's a quality big man who helped the Nuggets secured the 2nd seed in the Western Conference.

**Executive of the Year:** Danny Ferry, Cleveland.

Ferry brought in Mo Williams in the offseason and that trade paid off big time for the Cavs who dominated all season long.

**All NBA Team:**

G: Dwayne Wade
  
G: Kobe Bryant
  
F: LeBron James
  
F: Pau Gasol
  
C: Dwight Howard

**The Kobe Award**. Goes to the most electrifying player in the game today.

Dwayne Wade, Miami. This NBA season there was no better player than Dwayne Wade. He single handidly carried the Heat into the playoffs on his back. Whenever he had the ball in his hands you just expected something great to happen and Wade did not disappoint. From his crossovers to the electrifying dunks, D-Wade did it all this year.

Honourable Mention: LeBron James, Cleveland. Kevin Durant, OKC.

**Sexiest Crossover**: Derrick Rose, Chicago & Dwayne Wade, Miami.

These two mans were just breaking ankles this season. From Andre Miller to Anthony Parker and OJ Mayo. They just straight embrassed mans this year with their fast first steps and ridiculous handles.

Honourable Mentions: Jamal Crawford, Golden State.

**Most Surprising Team:** Miami Heat

I expected the Heat to contend for the 8th spot in the East but no way did I think they would do good as they did.

**Most Disappointing Team:** Toronto Raptors

This season was a straight disaster. From the trades to the injuries to the on court product. Hopefully next year they will fare better.

**Most Exciting Team:** LA Lakers

Of all the teams in the NBA, the Lakers were by far the most fun and exciting to watch. They were an offensive juggernaut who rarely had a boring game.

Honourable Mentions: Denver Nuggets. Cleveland Cavaliers. Portland Trailblazers.

**Most Boring Team:** LA Clippers

This team gave no effort all year long. They had one of the most talented teams on paper but on the court they straight out stank it up.

**Best Transaction:** Billups trade, Nuggets.

The Nuggets probably thought about this trade for a total of 2 seconds before agreeing. This was a no brainer for the Nuggets and Billups brought stability to a team who didn't know what to do last few years.

**Worst Transaction**: Iverson/J. O'Neal trade.

For the Pistons the Iverson experiment did not work out at all. They are just paying him to sit at home and do nothing except get banned from night clubs. The Raptors did not fare any better in the O'Neal trade. After it was all said and done, this is what we gave up to get Marion:

TJ Ford
  
Jermaine O'Neal
  
Rasho Nesterovic
  
Maceo Baston
  
Jamrio Moon
  
2008 1st Round Pick to Indiana (Herbert)
  
2010 1st Round Pick to Miami (Lottery Protected until 2014)

For

Shawn Marion
  
Marcus Banks
  
$3 Million for 1st Round Pick

Defintantly not BCs finest moment.

**Random Moment:** Zach Randolph, LA Clippers

His punch on Aumdson was straight random. I was watching that game and that punch had no reason behind and for whatever reason, Randolph just clocked him.

**Worst Coach & GM**: Mike Dunleavy, LA Clippers

His first job as GM should have been to fire himself as the coach. You can't have a team that's perfect for a run n gun system and not utilize them and you can't have a player liked Baron Davis and try to restrict him by trying to run sets all game long.

**Bitch Move:** Tracy McGrady, Houston

This man was all but traded to the Nets for Vince and once he got wind of it he announces he's having surgery just so the trade doesn't go through. On top of that, about 3 doctors told him he doesn't even need surgery.

And that's all of them. I'm with my man D, and I'm out.
