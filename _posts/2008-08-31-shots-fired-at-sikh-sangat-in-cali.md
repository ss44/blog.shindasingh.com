Usually when I think or talk about shots being fired towards Sangat, I would often think its about some verbal attack. But seems like in this case things got a little more literal, and someone actually fired bullets at Sangat in Sacremento. Not sure what the story is, but a Singh passed on the link so lets see what comes out in the coming days.

In the meantime heres a snippet off of youtube and some links that may better shed some light:
