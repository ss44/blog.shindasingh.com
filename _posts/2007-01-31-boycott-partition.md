          For those of you who follow the comments the above video clip isn't really news, but I thought I'd share it anyways. Incidentally Hollywood has decided to take an interest in the saga that once divided Punjab, and has decided to go down a path that even Bollywood is weary of traveling down. 
          
          <p>
            The thing that Bollywood understands better then Hollywood, is that even though '84 was a huge atrocity and slap against the Sikh psyche, the Sikh community in India and abroad is nonetheless greatly divided on the whole thing with many Sikhs themselves having accepted the blame for the events of the mid 80's. Yet when it comes to the topic of partition and India's independence the vast majority (of Sikhs) let their patriotism shine through. 
            
            <p>
              That goes without saying though, considering that a majority of those who suffered (lost land, wealth, lives etc) were Sikhs. Majority of the armed forces that battled against Pakistan at the time were Sikh (90% if memory serves me right), and it was the Sikhs after all who lost the freedom to access Nakana Sahib. Taking all that into account it should be no surprise that naturally a movie that tends to show Sikhs in a negative light in that whole saga won't exactly be praised or win any acclaims from this side.

                Now in all fairness I have yet to watch the trailer with any sound, but then again the pictures in the scenes do speak for themselves, and it's no surprise that this movie offends at multiple levels. First it attacks the sentiments of those who hold the Sikhi saroop in high esteem with the man's cutting his hair and all for his girl. Then it insults the more general Sikh populous with the whole converting to Islam (the enemy) thing. 
                
                <p>
                  How it ends up I guess you'd have to watch the movie to find out. Does he keep his kes again?, or does he win over his girl with his new found faith? Does their love conquer all and do they defy all religious, cultural and whatever other boundaries they had separating them to be together? Does Clark reveal his powers to Lana and steal her away from this fool? One can only speculate, but that would involve watching the movie, which after all we are trying to boycott. 
                  
                  <p>
                    Then again who really cares? Its just a movie, a chic flick at that, so who out of 'yall (those having already commented) would have gone to see this movie anyways? Be honest, by even bringing it this much attention we are doing exactly what the directors and producers always wanted, creating a buzz. A buzz, good or bad, which will create a sense of curiosity in peoples minds, making them to want and see more of the movie. Making those inept of pirating the movie from mininova to actually go and pay to even watch it, fueling the economic engine, making this project all worth while for the producers to begin with. 
                    
                    <p>
                      Now that i think about it, why are we so pissed again? Is it at the fact that they're showing a Singh converting to Islam? or are we pissed at them showing him cutting his hair? or was it that raunchy scene with him and Kristen that's got us all buzzing for the boycott? After all if thats whats got our kashera's in a knot then don't we got bigger problems to worry about, seeing as how 18 year olds are leaving Sangat, doing the devils powder, and murdering mans?

                        Oh well I said my piece, time to get back to work.
