Firstly for those of you who missed the hack or at the most miss the song that accompanied the defaced page, I included a [copy here](http://beta.shindasingh.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/34.htm). There have been quite a few rumours as to why the site got hacked and groups possibly responsible for hiring out a hit on the site.

This site nor the other sites, sikhsangatgenocide.com, sikhstudents.ca, etc. were part of any vicious agenda to cleanse the Internet of Kafir sites. More or less were victims to a middle-eastern kids boredom, and attempt to teach the world about peaceful Islam, after having been frustrated by the West's media coverage of all Muslims being Al-Quida supporters.

How the hack occurred, is pretty simple and nothing all that complicated. Basically a script on a site that shares the server had a huge security hole on it. Using google the hacker found the server hosting that script out and then using PHP uploaded a malicious program written in C. He then ran the C program using a bash script which wiped out all the PHP files on the server.

Leaving in tact all files, images, movies, audio, and databases etc, so end of the day not much was lost other then a few little things here and there, which given time I'll get back up.

Just to note, this site was part of [600 other sites](http://www.zone-h.org/component/option,com_attacks/Itemid,43/filter_defacer,ARsLaN_KSA_ABHA/) that the hacker had brought down, and to be honest thats pretty impressive. For those wanting to learn more about hacking type Internet security on the Internet and look for security based forums. There you'll find more then enough information on hacking servers, as for me, I'm going to stick with selling mortgages. Soo hollaa atcha boy..
