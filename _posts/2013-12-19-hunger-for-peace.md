  <strong><em>Nirbhao - Without Fear. Nirvaair - Without Hate.</em></strong>
</p>

  It is with the Mool Mantar that the sangat of Toronto was blessed with a live stream of Bhai Gurbaksh Singh, who has gone 35 days without any food. Who, was violently abducted just 2 weeks ago, by police to give up their cause. A cause which sees the freeing off illegally detained Sikh political prisoners, who have long since served there questionable jail sentences. The Punjab media has outright refused coverage of this, even after many punjabi actors, musicians, and dignitaries have all offered their support.

  It is easy to get lost in the grace that surrounds Bhai Sahib, but they offered a simple message to all Sikhs, one which we at this time we should all hede in respect for being a part of this protest:
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  1) Read Bani, as much of it as possible, and then some more. Do Ardaas that those Sikh prisoners currently held illegally are free'd by the State and Indian governments.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  2) Don't succumb to petty-ness and in-fighting. Now is not a time to ask where various groups are or why various people have yet to speak or show support. Guru Sahib themself are supporting this cause, and themselves graced Bhai Sahib with the feat to go this long without food.  As such - show no hate, for Bhai Sahib himself carries none. Recognize that it's never too late to support and join this protest. Focus on Baani, and spreading the word to all local media, and all branches of government in all governments across the world about the atrocities that continue to be committed against the Sikhs in India.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  When asked what would happen if the prisoners were not released, Bhai Gurbaksh Singh humbly bowed their head and replied, “Then I will say my final Fateh, and hope that I can be born again to serve the Khalsa Panth and continue this fight,”
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  It is in recognition of this humility that I ask anyone not familiar with what's going on to learn more. By all means feel free to ask your questions and be sure to check out the many youtube videos, dozens of Facebook groups and websites all over the internet which are flooded with information surrounding this issue. Better yet, tell one person who you don’t suspect knows a thing about what’s going on and fill them in, then ask that they do the same.
