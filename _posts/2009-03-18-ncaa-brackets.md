With March Madness on us, its time to jump on the NCAA bandwagon and pretend like I've been following every game this season and know every team inside and out and submit to y'all our brackets for this years tourny.

**Shinda's Bracket**

I haven't watched a single game this year except for Memphis vs Tulsa and Memphis looked wicked. While some have criticized my love for Memphis based on them being able to blow out some shitty competition but either way, I was impressed enough to have them go all the way.

**Gagan's Bracket**

Self proclaimed NBA pundit and analyst Gagan has UNC winning the tourny. After speaking with him this may be his worst bracket to date since he claims he didn't really do any research except reading some articles on ESPN, watching some highlights on the Score, and interacting with his personal acquaintance Cabbie who recently gifted Gagan MLB 09. His picks may do better then mine, and if they don't it'll just prove that you don't need to know what you're doing to win this.

Lastly, don't hold it against me if you wager everything you own and end up coming short because for some reason you thought it wise to use either of our picks to try it and make it big. We can not be held responsible for the stupidity of others, and many times even refuse to accept responsibility for our own.
