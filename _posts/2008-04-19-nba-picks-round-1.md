In response to the Sarpanch's NBA Playoffs [East](http://www.pindgagan.com/?p=431) & <a href="http://www.pindgagan.com/?p=432" target="_blank">West</a> picks here they are.

Firstly gotta start with the East because like Bigs said, "If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East...I live out there, so don't go there"****

**East**

Celtics - 4 Games
  
Cavs - 6 Games
  
Pistons - 4 Games
  
Raptors - 6 Games

**West
  
** 

Lakers - 6 Games
  
Jazz - 7 Games
  
Hornets - 7 Games
  
Suns - 6 Games

The West without saying will be insane, every series possible is worthy of a conference final in the past. As for the east I think we'll be looking at a Celtics, Piston domination.

For bonus points I'm giving the finals to the Celtics, even though I'd much rather see the Suns come out on top. If they can't do it this year, I don't see them being able to do it in the next 5, at least not with there current who have been making runs at the big show for the last 4 years.
