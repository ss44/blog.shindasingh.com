I wanted to write up on this news when I first found out, last Friday, but then again I knew very little about Bhai Sahibs life, other then their recordings. 

When it comes to khavis or dhaadis the only name that resonates within youth circles these days is the Jago Wale Jatha, and rightfully so, since they are talented and part of only the handful of Dhadhis who will _still_ openly talk and sing about 84. So little do most of us know (myself included) about individuals such as Bhai Dya Singh Dilbar. 

With the passing of each dhadi it can only raise the question whether we will have other such great poets in the future, especially with the decline of youth masterfully learning Punjabi these days, but one can only hope.

I included a sample recording of one of favorite recordings done by Bhai Dya Singh, [audio: http://www.gursikhijeevan.com/media/audio/Dhadi\_Vaaran/Bhai\_Daya\_Singh\_Dilbar/Taig\_Vichoo\_Paidaa_Hoya%28Part2%29.mp3]
