If the death of a conscience is a sure death then by the same virtue, the creation of one must be a true birth. It was on this day 23 years ago that the Indian Army took it upon themselves to storm the holiest of Sikh shrines, <span class="misspell">Sri</span> <span class="misspell">Harmandir</span> Sahib aka The Golden Temple, in what they dubbed Operation Blue Star. What followed was the genocide of Sikhs from within the Punjab and India itself. Hundreds of thousands of Sikhs were wiped out in fake police encounters, mob riots and other government sponsored programmes. It was an attempt to cleanse the state of what was dubbed by&nbsp;many in Parliament as the "Sikh Problem", and they decided the best cure was amputation at its very roots, by wiping out an entire generation of Sikhs.

Now as much as people want to dilute what happened in 84 as being a political problem, or one that was between a minority and the government they fail to recognize the actual facts of what happened. When they ask why was <span class="misspell">Harmandir</span> Sahib fortified I ask why were hundreds of other Sikh temples <span class="misspell">sieged</span>? Why did they not convict <span class="misspell">Sant</span> <span class="misspell">Jarnail</span> Singh, as they had done previously,&nbsp;if he's all they wanted? Why did they lock hundreds of women and children in <span class="misspell">the Parkarma</span> and not let them leave having left the fight between them [the army] and the <span class="misspell">Singhs</span>? Why was it that those who committed the atrocities, that Human Rights organizations the world over recognize, go on to receive awards, and seats in Parliament? Why was it that hundreds of girls were raped in front of their fathers? Why was it that those who investigated the happenings of 84 were kidnapped and killed? Why is it that any independent news reporter or source who looks at what happened in 84 come to learn of the same reality that Sikhs have been holding onto for years?

1984 was never about a single person or a group of people. It was about sending a message that <span class="misspell">Sikhi</span> in its purest form would not be tolerated. It was about sending a message through intimidation that we own you, and you are ours. They never did accomplish that in its entirety, instead through Guru Sahibs <span class="misspell">kirpa</span>, they created a day that is ire marked in the <span class="misspell">fathoms</span> of history as the day when a few hundred <span class="misspell">Singhs</span> withstood the brute might of the Indian army for a few days. A day when, with nothing more then a limited supply of bullets and resources, a few hundred <span class="misspell">Singhs</span> withstood the fury and might of the largest hypocrisy in the World, and gave birth to a relative new&nbsp; consciousness amongst Sikhs the world over.

A consciousness that inspired thousands at that time to give up their <span class="misspell">illicit</span> ways and return to adopt the values of their forefathers. A day that continues to inspire hundreds of youth to realize the truth of their not so distant past and make an effort to return to their roots. A day that the Indian army tried to bring death to an ideology and kill away the conscience beliefs of the Sikhs, instead turned into a day that they helped plant the seed that continues to give birth to that very conscience every day. It was the very conscience that made me look into my past and history and <span class="misspell">dwelve</span> deeper into learning about <span class="misspell">Sikhi</span>. A day that made me go the <span class="misspell">Gurdwara</span> and ask why, and a day that I give thanks, as it was the day that inspired me and gave birth to my very own consciousness. It truly is a day of birth, not one that is physical or biological in nature, but a real birth, the birth of a conscience.
