From drug peddling, gang violence, to corruption in our Gurdwaray, it seems like we're a cesspool of social ill's. The most repulsive of which has got to be the whole deal with [female foeticide](http://thelangarhall.com/sikhi/sikh-literature-combats-female-feticide/). Even now thinking of how or where begin to comment on the matter, is just boggling. How do you begin a topic or even have a discussion on something so barbaric and ill conceived that you just need to raise your eyebrow and wonder, "what the fuck?".

It's to that end that its embarrassing reading the](http://www.parentcentral.ca/parent/newsfeatures/article/704904) today when an under cover investigation found Kanwar "Sunny" Bains, [editor at Ajit Weekly,](http://www.ajitweekly.org/about.htm) offering up some magical pills that would influence the sex of an unborn child.

As embarrassing as it maybe, its high time we start getting called out on all the stupidness that exists within our community, at least that way if nothing else we maybe shamed into making some changes. Let public opinion within the community resonate that we're actually against this type of shit and then just maybe the leaders will take notice and actually try to "lead" us away from it. How amazing it would be to hear a precharak sit on stage at a prime time program and let it rip that those who talk or even think of such things reserve a spot not only for themselves but there entire families in Narkh.

As far as the accused, Kanwar Bains, its hard to hate on a potential scab who's only fulfilling a demand, capitalizing off of the fears that Punjabis have towards having a girl, and making a quick profit selling whatever it is that he's pushing. After all, why waste time hating on the player, when its all in the game.

All the same though, if the allegations are true then maybe its time we put pressure on the paper by bringing them into this, after all its the media that shapes opinion and if this is opinion that they want to shape, that female fecticide is acceptable, then maybe its time that the community disconnect rid itself of such media, boycotts work wonders when it hurts peoples bottom line.

Anyways, on such a note its only fitting to share [Humble's](http://thepoetproject.blogspot.com/) latest video which is dedicated to such matters, probably one of his greatest tracks yet - Love Her ft. Sikh Knowledge.
