Honestly, I was never going to bring this up again but after seeing the following video, I just had to.

This video emphatically proves what I've been saying for so damn long. Judge for yourselves.



That video not only made me laugh at loud but also made me nod my head because I see some of those things happening on a daily basis. Especially the parking one. The guy who parked her car didn't do it because he was nice but rather he jus got pissed at the woman for being an idiot.

And right now I only got one available arm and still I can drive better than half the women out there.

Take women drivers off the roads = Less pollution = Save the Earth.

So if you look at it, it helps everybody.
