During the reading week, having some time to spare, I thought it be a good time to watch season 3 of 24. For those of you who have never watched this show, and really do value your time, dont watch it, because like a bag of Lays chips, I bet you cant watch just one (episode at a time).

Anyways I finished watching season 3 last night, so like with the previous two seasons I thought Id rant about it.

Now the rest of this is a spoiler so doesnt bother reading on, if you do plan on watching it. Also I thought it would make more sense to put the fine print at the top instead of the bottom so that you can actually read it before you continue on.

**Disclaimer**
  
Many of you may be offended by the following. Many of you will read this and wonder why you just read it. If you value your time, dont bother reading on. If you have never heard of 24, then the following will be nothing more then babble, which has no meaning or purpose. Reading the below, will in no way get you mukhti let alone inspire you into Sikhi. If anything the following may be detrimental to your jeevan, as you would have wasted many breaths that you could have spent more productively reading Bani or studying. If you feel this disclaimer itself have been a huge waste of your time, then by no means should you continue reading any further as the rest of this post is filled with similar nonsense. If you are offended by jokes made about females, dont have a sense of humor or are just overall a pain, then you are asked not to continue reading. By continuing to read you agree to the above terms and will not message me telling me that I wasted your time. Thank you.</p> 

* * *Im not sure if I liked this season more then season 2. I dont think it was near as suspenseful although it took just as many twists and turns. The fact that Nina made an appearance was probably the most shocking, considering I thought she was long gone, but I doubt well be seeing any more of her.Unlike other seasons the females in the show really redeemed themselves from the stupidity rep that they had developed in previous seasons.

Not only did Kim seem to be a little smarter this time, she didnt cause near as much trouble as she did in previous seasons. Although she is still proving most blonde stereotypes to hold true, she didnt directly get anyone killed this time. Actually she did mess up when Chase told her about going after her father, but then again she did come clean to Tony about it later so all in all, good job Kim.[<img width="100" height="134" border="0" align="left" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/2423-726169.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/2423-728772.jpg)**_Smartest Female Award,_** goes tothis was a really tough one, and I think this maybe a new category for this season considering the past few seasons most the females on the show, proved themselves to be incredibly stupid. The candidates are, Nina Myers, Sherry Palmer, and off course Michelle Dessler. Taking all things into consideration Id have to give this one to Michelle. Main reason, she made it out alive. Her going into the hotel after knowing she could have died only goes to gives her points here, but really the fact that she got away from Saunders and the way she did, really made her stand out from the rest. Good job Michelle.</p> 

**_Most Evil Female Award_** goes to.another tough one. This one is between either Sherry Palmer, or Nina Myers.

[<img width="119" height="121" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/2375-740988.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/2375-743489.jpg)Nina Myers is just plain evil, but then again shes like the female version of Jack. The way she faked suicide then killed all the medical staff and got away, was just brilliant, yet the gruesome deaths she bestowed on the med staff, was just plain evil. But Sherry, wow. I guess President Palmer was right, she is just a shark. Watching Milken die slow in front of her and not even flinching, then not even a minute later making up an alibi. But what really topped it off, was when she turned on President Palmer himself and tried to blackmail her way back into his life, after potentially killing his political career, evil, just evil.

Congratulations Sherry, your season 3s recipient of the _Most Evil Female award_.

Now, it wouldnt be fair to label her stupid, considering how ill she was, when dealing with the worm virus, and all her other technical skills, but I think there were multiple times in this season where I felt like telling her to SHUT UP!. Her random comments, by the book attitude were just plain out annoying. Just thinking back gives me the shivers, congratulations Chloe youre this years recipient.

And now ladies and gentlemen we have come to the award most of you have been waiting for.

The candidates for this seasons Stupid Female Award are, Anne Packard, Julia Milliken, and Claudia Salazar.

**Anne Packard** 
  
You can admire her convictions to doing whats right and noble and all that, but lets not forget her naïve ways almost hurt President Palmers campaign. I guess you could say, he was saved by the terrorist attack. Also for going over to her ex-husbands place without asking anyone first and knowing everything going on with him, could have been potentially disastrous. However, Ill give it to Anne for knowing that she messed up, and just leaving the scene.

**Julia Milliken**
  
So what, if Julias a gold digger, you cant really hold that against her. What I will hold against her though is the whole suicide murder. Why not just relax and think things through. Oh yea, I forgot, YOUR STUPID!! Chullo, I wont go into further details about her, she was just dumb.

**Claudia Salazar**
  
I admire her convictions and bravery to get out alive. Heck, I was even sad to see her die, the way she did, but come on now, you know you could have handled the situation better. I guess its unfair to put her in this category, but alas I already typed it up, and dont feel like pressing backspace or delete, so well just continue on.

So this years winner is(drum roll please)Julia Milken. Not only did she complicate things for everyone, she also ended her own life. Good job Julia. Im glad that youre one face we wont have to see ever again.

And that ladies and gentlemen is a wrap. We thank you for, whatever reason you had, to read through all this. We apologize but your time is non refundable and well yes that is that.
