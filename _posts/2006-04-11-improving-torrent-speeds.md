For a while now I've been looking to find ways to improve my torrent download speeds, after all the only thing better then being able to download anything, is to be able to download anything fast.

Firstly, if you have no clue what Torrents are, then understand them to be the latest fad in downloading and sharing files. I could go into more depth on it, but if you havn't needed or used torrents yet, the chances of you needed using torrents is pretty slim.

Firstly lets deal with the basics:

**The Client**
  
The client is the program used to actually download the files. Now I've used most of them out there and I can cleary say that [For a while now I've been looking to find ways to improve my torrent download speeds, after all the only thing better then being able to download anything, is to be able to download anything fast.

- Azereus slowed down my computer, making it a pain to download and work normally , but it does come loaded with features.
  
- BitTornado, didn't deliver on the speed, and lacked the User Interface,
  
- BitLord an adware / spyware version of BitCommet.

So my advice is to get [BitComet](http://www.bitcomet.com/). It works, its fast, doesn't have problems, what more could you ask for.

**Change your DMZ settings** 
  
If you're using a router, chances are your computer doesn't have direct access to the internet. You can change that by enabling DMZ or port forwarding, that way your computer can get direct access to the internet (indeed making your computer more susceptible to being hacked, and getting a virus, but you may get faster downloads).

**Choose your Torrent Files wisely**.
  
Nearly all torrent sites list the number of seeds and peers. A good torrent file is one where the seeds:peer ratio is closest or greater then 1. So a file with a seed-peer ratio of 50:50 is better then one with a ratio of 50:1000.

**Disable Windows firewall.**
  
Yes it puts you at the mercy of hackers and virus's, but it also helps improve download speeds.

To disable windows firewall:

  * Go to Control Panel.
  * Click Windows Firewall.
  * Click on off and go OK.

You could configure your settings and all that, and still have your firewall on, but that would require further explanation and I dont want type all that up. Also chances are you got other firewalls that came installed with windows, that you may need to configure / turn off, which I'll leave you to figure out on how to do on your own.

Now that we got the basics out of the way, there are a few other things you could try, such as patching your windows and changing the number of open ports and also capping your upload speeds.For more info on how to do those and some other tips check out [this thread](http://torrentfreak.com/speed-up-your-torrents/) on [torrentfreak.com](http://torrentfreak.com/).

As always, I can't guarantee that doing all the above will fix things but if you are having problems, then you can try each step individually and one of these may just work for you.
