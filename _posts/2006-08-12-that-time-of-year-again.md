Summers quickly coming to and end, and many of you have once again found yourselves sitting at home, having done nothing that you planned on doing. Not to worry, the most popular Gurmat Camp in Toronto is back yet again to help rescue you, from your miserable state and hopefully teach you something yet again.

Come one, come all to another soon to be famous not easily forgotten Gurmat Camp, organized by COSS so sign up today. Yes I know the camps starting in a day and half, and yes I realize this isn't much notice, but with the limited spaces available, you need to act now!!!...So yea, tell your parents that you'll go with them to the beach another time and post-pone your trips to wonderland with your friends and instead make sure you come out to this years Gurmat Camp at Jot Parkash, otherwise you'll be left listening to stories about how good the camp was, how you missed and how there was never a better youth camp ever. So do what you got to do, and make sure you come out...

If you're looking for reasons to come out look no further then the video below...For questions call Jasdev Singh at 416.835.1909 or email COSS @ <info@sikhstudents.ca>.
