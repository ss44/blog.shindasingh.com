Another year. Another sexual harassment case against a Knick. No it's not Marbury... for once. Although it is another bench warmer.

> ## KNICK SLAPPED WITH SEX-HARASS SUIT
> 
> ## GUY DRIVER: EDDY CURRY PUT MOVES ON ME

>   Knicks center <a class="topiclink" href="http://www.nypost.com/topics/topic.php?t=Eddy_Curry">Eddy Curry</a> was slapped with a shocking sex-harassment suit Monday by his former driver, who claims the 6-foot-11 hoopster tried to solicit gay sex from him.
> </p>
> 
> The stunning court papers claim Curry, a married father of three, repeatedly approached chauffeur David Kuchinsky "in the nude," allegedly telling him, "Look at me, Dave, look" and "Come and touch it, Dave."
> 
> Curry also made Kuchinsky perform "humiliating tasks outside the scope of his employment, such as cleaning up and removing dirty towels [Curry had ejaculated into] so that his wife would not see them," the Manhattan federal court suit says.
> 
> Kuchinsky, who is straight and Jewish, also alleges racial discrimination, saying that Curry hurled slurs at him including "f\---ing Jew," "cracker," "white slave," "white devil" and "grandmaster of the KKK."
> 
> The sex allegations hark back to the bad old days of Isiah Thomas running the team, when the team's VP of marketing, Anucha Browne Sanders, filed a 2006 sexual harassment suit claiming the general manager made advances toward her and even said he "loved" her. He also allegedly called her "ho" and "bitch."
> 
> <p class="snap_noshots">
>   She also complained the team was allowed to become a sleazy old-boys club, in which <a class="topiclink" href="http://www.nypost.com/topics/topic.php?t=Stephon_Marbury">Stephon Marbury</a> had sex with a female intern in an SUV. In the end, Sanders was awarded $11.6 million in punitive damages and the Knicks settled with her.
> </p>
> 
> And in a disturbing episode reminiscent of some of the evidence in the manslaughter case against former Nets star Jayson Williams, Kuchinsky further claims in his suit that Curry pointed a "fully loaded" gun at him on at least two separate occasions to keep him from complaining about his treatment.
> 
> "Look, I have one in the chamber," Curry allegedly said.
> 
> Kuchinsky, who worked for Curry from October 2005 through October 2008, says he was initially hired as an around-the-clock chauffeur for Curry and his family at their Burr Ridge, Ill., mansion.
> 
> But shortly after starting work, he soon found his duties fell well outside his job description and "progressively became Curry's "house-boy,'" his suit says. He is seeking $98,000 plus compensatory damages from the injured Knick, whose contract pays him $9.4 million this year.
> 
> Kuchinsky says he is owed $68,000 in unpaid wages, as well as $25,000 in expenses for which Curry never repaid him.
> 
> "Instead of paying him, they discriminated against him, figuring that it would keep him there," said Kuchinsky's lawyer, Matthew Blit. "Imagine going into your boss's office ... and he stands up and drops his pants and he asks you take care of him. Those actions are unacceptable whether it's in a corporate office or a private home."
> 
> Curry, who has played just 2 minutes, 38 seconds this season because of knee injuries, declined to comment late Monday in New Orleans, where he was expected to sit out the Knicks' game against the Hornets.
> 
> His lawyer, Kelly Saindon, denied all of Kuchinsky's allegations, calling them "absolutely untrue," and saying he began making a series of claims for unpaid wages several months ago, upping the ante each time.
> 
> Saindon said Curry took a chance on hiring Kuchinsky despite a criminal record that includes a three-year prison sentence for a 1992 burglary in New Jersey. He also got three years' probation in a 2004 resisting-arrest case in the Garden State, records show.
> 
> "It's shocking that Eddy opened his home to a convicted felon out of prison, and gave him a job when he couldn't find a job, and this is what comes out of it," she said. "The entire thing is preposterous."
> 
> Kuchinsky's lawyer conceded his client's "troubled past," but said that was all behind him.
> 
> Additional reporting by Marc Berman

And just for the record, I think it's all bullshit but think of the jokes Eddy Curry is going to have to put up with for the rest of the season. Or the type of jokes one can make while using Curry as an example. This could end up being very, very funny.
