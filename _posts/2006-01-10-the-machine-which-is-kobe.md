Firstly the Raptors lost again, and to quote one of man's,

> they won a couple of games against shitty teams ex. Atlanta that boosted their confidence now their playing on a confidence that they shouldn't really have cause in actuality their shitty but the confidence is helping them win some extra games

I remember listening to Fan 590 one night after a Raptors game, and the host (Can't remember if it was Chuck) said that the one thing Raptors fans need to remember is that we're (The Raptors) are not as good as we think they are when they win, but at the same time their not as bad as we think they are when they loose.

With that said its time to move on to more _positive_ things, and that is the man whom they call Kobe Bryant. Never , even including Jordan, has anyone seen a player so tenacious that even NBA players are shocked at his performance. Now far be it for me to be a Kobe fan, his arrogance astounds me, but I'll give the man the respect that he deserves after scoring 45 or more points in 4 consecutive games. He literally put the Lakers on his back and ran with them. All other players who have tried to do the same end up with their backs buckling under pressure.

We've seen it in the past with Iverson, Carter, and others, but so far Kobe shows no intention on slowing down. So with that said its time to bless this blog with that which is Kobe, hope yall enjoy:
