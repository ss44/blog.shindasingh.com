I'll just cop this story of the [Brampton Guardian Site](http://www.northpeel.com), since news stories only last for so long on them. Weird thing about Brampton is that its a pretty middle class suberb. Notice the desi employees.

> Peel police are asking for help in solving a takeover-style bank robbery in Brampton.
> 
> On Monday, Jan. 23, at 1:20 p.m., three men entered the TD Canada Trust on Worthington Avenue in the area of Bovaird Drive and Creditview Road. One of the suspects was armed with a shotgun and the trio took over the bank. Employees and customers were ordered to the floor.
> 
> One of the suspects vaulted the teller counter and demanded cash. The terrified victim handed over a quantity of cash. The armed thugs then ran out and got away in what investigators believe is an older model dark green Honda Accord.
> 
> Bank surveillance video captured images of the suspects and pictures can be seen on the Web site at [www.peel police.on.ca](http://www.peelpolice.on.ca/).
> 
> The first suspect is described as male, black, 22, with a slim build, wearing a black, long T-shirt, dark pants, knitted baseball cap and a blue bandanna. He was armed with the shotgun.
> 
> The second suspect is described as male, black, 5-foot-5, 150 pounds, wearing a camouflage green coat with a hooded sweatshirt, dark mask, blue bandanna, black gloves and carrying a green duffle bag.
> 
> The third suspect is male, black, 6-foot, 180 pounds, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, black ski mask and black do-rag.
> 
> Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

> Drugs involved in kidnapping PAM DOUGLAS
> 
> The disappearance of 300 kg of marijuana destined for delivery by truck to the United States from a Springdale home earlier this month appears to have been the motive behind the kidnapping and beating of Brampton truck driver Balkar Singh last Friday.
> 
> The smuggling of marijuana and possibly other drugs across the border by transport truck appears to be at the heart of the case, according to police sources. Police believe the drug runners' search for the stolen marijuana led to Singh's abduction and beating, _The Brampton Guardian_ has learned.
> 
> The investigation into Singh's daylight, gunpoint abduction and release two days later has taken some strange twists. The latest was a media report this week that a tape of Singh's beating while he was being held captive was delivered to a Toronto-area Punjabi media outlet.
> 
> Peel police detectives investigating the case were working yesterday to obtain a copy of that tape. Why the tape was made, and who made it, could be a key part of the ongoing investigation, according to police.
> 
> Earlier this week, two men surrendered to police and were charged in the abduction. Sukhjit Dhaliwal, 31, of Woodbridge, and Amandeep Soos, 25, of Brampton are charged with conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, forcible confinement, aggravated assault and several firearms offences. Monday is their next court appearance.
> 
> Other arrests are expected as a special 22 Division task force continues to investigate the abduction and other criminal offences. Four men snatched Singh at gunpoint at 4:30 p.m. Friday as he walked in a plaza parking lot at Kennedy Road and Clarence Street.
> 
> The investigation led police to a rural house in Caledon early Monday morning where Tactical Unit officers were confronted by armed men.
> 
> Rajesh Owaan, 21, of Concord was shot and killed by police in the confrontation inside the home on Bramalea Road north of Mayfield Road.
> 
> Jagdeep Singh, 43, of Hamilton was also inside the house and he was hit in the leg by a bullet. He was taken to Peel Memorial Hospital with non-life threatening injuries. He appeared in court Tuesday, and is now charged with breach of probation, breach of recognizance and several firearms offences. He has not been charged in connection with the abduction of Balkar Singh, who is not related to Jagdeep Singh. He is also scheduled to appear in court again Jan. 23.
> 
> Police have been busy obtaining and executing more search warrants at the Caledon house and property, but they have not revealed what it is they are looking for.
> 
> The province's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is conducting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shooting, which involved two Peel police officers. A third officer has been designated as a witness by the SIU.
> 
> Police say Singh was snatched at gunpoint and forced into a rented minivan at 4:30 p.m. Friday. The minivan, an SUV and a car believed involved in the kidnapping were later recovered-one in Brampton, the other two in Toronto.
> 
> Singh arrived home in a taxi at 8 p.m. Sunday. He had suffered minor injuries during the ordeal and was treated in hospital before being extensively questioned by police.
> 
> Singh is known to police and two years ago he was the victim of a shooting on Hwy. 401 near London. OPP at the time ruled it a case of road rage. Singh, who was driving a truck at the time, was shot in the shoulder.
> 
> Anyone with information is asked to call the 22 Division Criminal Investigation Bureau at 905-453-2121, ext. 2233, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).
