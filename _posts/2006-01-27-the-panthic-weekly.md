[<img width="233" height="183" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/pw-704764.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/pw-712386.jpg)[Panthic.org](http://www.panthic.org/) is a new and upcoming Sikhi news site, which has been doing a tremendous sevaa, especially in the West, featuring many **original** articles and news breaking exposes. Some of the big ones to date include the _breaking_ of the Daljeet Singh (Chicago), story which was then later picked up by others, and more recently the story on Rulda, an RSS agent who supposedly _infiltrated_ main stream Sikh groups, with audio evidence and all.

Before Panthic Weekly arrived, the main sources for many people looking for Panthic News, was [The Tribune](http://www.tribuneindia.com/) and for western happenings, [Sanjh Savera](http://www.sanjhsavera.com/). The later, being a Punjabi only paper that left many youth who can't read punjabi scratching their heads.

So it goes without saying that what Panthic Weekly is doing is an awesome thing, and we can only wait for it to grow, hoping that it one day becomes biweekly, until one day when it features updates everday.

However, such growth does not come without suffering growing pains. A [recent thread](http://forums.waheguroo.com/index.php?showtopic=13116) on the [Sikhi Unleashed](http://forums.waheguroo.com/) forums suggested or at least left, what I would think was positive criticism. Unfortunately some of those connected with Panthic Weekly or supporters of it felt such criticism was insulting, which is pretty sad considering all of it was valid.

Basically the main points raised by Simmal Tree, were all surrounding the recent expose on Rulda (The RSS agent) and how the paper is starting to look like a Tabloid versus a credible impartial news paper.

> for example, there is no use of the word ALLEGED. all of the rulda's statements are allegations, but the article does not use the word alleged or "claimed" and therefore they seem to be truth.
> 
> secondly, there is no use of quotations. so things that rulda specifically said are mixed with things that the editors wrote, leaving readers to wonder what are ultimately the facts.
> 
> thirdly, bold red text is used to emphasize that sant baba thakur singh ji is alleged to have given a siropa to the head of the rss in the form of a shawl. firstly, the bold red is for what type of dramatic effect? there is no taste in that - it is only for the shock effect, and it is not needed. secondly, it is an allegation, not a statement of truth. and lastly, if this really did happen, then panthic weekly should have done some homework to try to find out why this happened, and get some type of justification out of representatives of the taksal or people who did seva with baba ji.
> 
> fourth, baba ji's picture is placed right next to the rss cheif's picture, as if both are some culprits in some master plot. the purposeful arrangement of the whole article makes it look like a propaganda article rather than a news article.

Now, I donÂ’t see anything wrong being said, and off course everyone is entitled to there opinion. Supporters of Panthic Weekly provided rebuttals, to the above points of concern, and rightfully so cleared up much of the above up from the Panthic Weekly perspective.

One thing that was mentioned however, that seemed somewhat curious, was a remark by The Avenger,

> If you have some concerns about Panthic Weekly or criticism you should send those directly to Panthic Weekly. What do you think?"I beleive you can get their email from the website: www.panthic.org

Now for a paper so keen on releasing the truth, it seems questionable as to why they would object to people taking offense to an article, or let alone express there views and provide certain criticism on a public forum, after all if Panthic Weekly is out for the truth, then it should always be ready to defend itself and justify itself without worry, after all if they didn't, then they themselves would be going against the one practice they feel they examiplify, that being making things transparent for the public/sangat.

Also in defending itself as a paper without Jatha bias, supporters on the forum made note that no one doing wrong is safe and I agree 100%, anyone doing wrong should be pointed out. They quickly made note that AKJI has also been singled out, however one thing I noticed while looking at [that article](http://www.panthic.org/news/125/ARTICLE/2173/2006-01-15.html) was the editorial note that seemingly gave the AKJ perspective on the issue or at least the individual. Leading me to wonder why no such feedback was sought from the other groups mentioned on what they had to say about things and also why the editors felt it nessary to clarify such information.

Also in replying to Simmal Tree's third point about the bold red text, (trying to sensationalize the article), supporters pointed out that it was more to do with the outrageous remarks made by Rulda, then to show Baba Takhur Singh in a negative light. However many other statements made by Rulda were just as outrageous, yet none of these received the same treatment of bold text, and highlighting, which can only lead one to feel that a certain bias is at play.

So clearly Panthic Weekly has ways to go, and things that it needs to sort out if it wish's to truly become a _Panthic paper_. It has made many positive strides in the small time that it has been around, but it should quickly sort these little things out now if it wants to continue with its success.
