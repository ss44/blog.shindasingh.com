(Yes it was stolen from the Google Quote of the day)

Amazing how that fits to every single level of politics that I've ever been familiar with. From inner-group politics, Sikhi, Federal, Provincial, Municipal. everywhere. Even after listening to politicians speak on a daily basis about the "wrong" in our society that they intend to fix. After taking a look at it, doesn't really seem like there is much wrong, and this goes for everything you can possibly think of. The danger of a seasoned politician is they bite into a really tight knot, at whatever point they perceive to be the weakest, hold on as tight and just pull. They may need to adjust here or there, but sooner or later if they keep pulling things will un-ravel and when that strong knot comes loose, well then they're free to make whatever adjustments they see fit.. But then again end of the day, we're all politians to some degree, so we can either play the cards in our favour or against us, that is one choice entirely left on how we choose to play the game.
