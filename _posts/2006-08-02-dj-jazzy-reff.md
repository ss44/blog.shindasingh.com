  For those of you with no sound then your missing out. If you're really going to go and shoot a video then at least make sure that you don't mumble when you spit your lines, at least that way people can hear the stupidness coming out your mouth. But I have to say this video made my day. That bhangra scene in the back yard, Russle Peters couldn't have scripted anything better.

  The video speaks for itself, interestingly it turns out this man served in the Nagar Kirtan punj before, from walking the fine line mans now a backyard super star. Made my day, well morning, I'm sure it'll make yours.
