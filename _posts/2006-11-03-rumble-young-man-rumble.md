Its amazing what you'll find on YouTube. It's even more perplexing to imagine that random people got video cameras on them, catching things such as a school yard fights out of the blue. To add to the irony of the whole thing how often would you expect that those caught on camera end up being those same kids who you've seen grow up.

Anyway's check out our very own Singh go up against someone outside his weight class in this one on one. From the end result and from the description left by the person on YouTube seems like the Singh wins, although the Dastaar unraveling is always a problem.

Even though many may get irked by the video, for me anyways, there's always a level of pride felt when you see a Singh hold his own, especially in a day when all you hear about is Singhs getting pushed around. For those really offended by it, mans are young, and young men rumble. So with that said, rumble young man rumble.
