So many times we find Sikhs being miss-represented in the media. Whether its shows hinting that Sikhs are terrorists or just re-justifying stereotypes of all people who wear turbans being linked to terrorism in some way. Its safe to say that if you see a Sikh youre not really educated as to them being something other then what people already think when they see them and thats someone of Arabic, Islamic descent. You only need to go back a few posts and watch the Sikh in the Street video to confirm this.

So the other week while I was in Toronto for the weekend, I ran into one of my boys who suggested I watch this show called [Sleeper Cell](http://www.tv.com/sleeper-cell/show/28827/summary.html?q=Sleeper%20Cell). As you may guess from the title, its main focus is terrorism, in a post 9-11.world. The basic premise for the show without giving too much away is the FBI tries to infiltrate a sleeper cell which plans to run a terrorist attack on the States. It seems to be a show that tries to show that terrorism is not confined to a single nationality, race etc. with the terrorists all being Muslims of different races, backgrounds etc. and that its an evil perverted form of Islam that promotes terrorism.

Anyways, like I was talking about earlier many Hollywood types fail to distinguish the difference between Sikhs, Muslims, Persians etc and rather just clump us all together. Its for that reason that I think its nice to see something that while keeping with the whole drama mood shows and teaches something else, anyways heres a clip with what Im talking about.



I think more stuff like this can go a long way.
