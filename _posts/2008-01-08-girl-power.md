The following essay, was sent by Bibi Himmat Kaur via the prodigal godson who recently returned home from [the islands](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2006/02/21/the-way-schooling-ought-to-be/) after having graduated and finished schooling while living it up under the the [Caribbean sun](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2006/02/21/the-way-schooling-ought-to-be/).

The essay offers an interesting and alternative view point to that of the whole Kaurageous movement that has taken over and became the fad amongst bibian in the West as of late. For those having trouble decyiphering the garbled text, you may want to try and download and install [Gurbani Web Thick](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/gurbaniwebthick.ttf "Gurbani Web Thick"). For those scratching their heads you can also grab the [PDF](http://beta.shindasingh.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/girlpower.pdf) and hopefully view things as they were intended by [clicking here](http://beta.shindasingh.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/girlpower.pdf).

  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">Dear Brothers & Sisters of this infinitely beautiful Sikh Nation, this essay about the image and attitude of women in contemporary Sikhi (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">is~KI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">) is a dedication to you.

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">We live in a world that is still gripped with gender inequality, so in a male-dominant society a woman still feels the need to prove her worth in the work force, in social circles and most unfortunately in our Sikh panth as well. The latter arena is the most concerning, since Guru Sahib created his Sikhs equally and prescribed ways for us to live that would ensure that equality. </font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">Please allow me to further explore the above mentioned issues by posing a question. Have you ever heard the saying:</font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in" align="center">
  “<font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>The eye does not see what the mind does not know.”</em></font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">For example, pretend that you are taking a stroll in a garden that has thousands of different types of flowers. At the end of your stroll your friend asks you “what flowers did you see in the garden?” you could only tell them about the flowers that you already know about. So you might say “I saw roses, lilies, lilacs etc” but you wouldn’t say “I saw a plumeria, a hibiscus, or a lantana.” So even though those flowers were in the garden you didn’t know what they looked like, so your eyes just glanced over them without mentally processing them. You would have to learn about those flowers, then re-visit that garden and only then will your eye recognize them.</font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">There is a similar trend in global-society, and even within contemporary Sikhi that I was totally oblivious too until it was pointed out to me. If you ever examine this matter, then you will also realize the truth in it. In Sikhi when you think of </font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>girl-power,</em></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"> who comes to mind? Naturally the first image that comes to mind is Mata Bhag Kaur Ji (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">mwqw Bwg kOr jI </font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">aka Mai Bhago </font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">mweI Bwgo jI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">), Mata Sada Kaur Ji (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">mwqw sdw kOr jI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">) or other female-warriors. Rarely will anyone tell you that they initially pictured Mata Sahib Kaur Ji (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">jgq mwqw swihb kOr jI; </font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">Mother of the Khalsa) or Mata Khivi Ji (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">jgq mwqw KIvI jI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"> Guru Angad dev sahib ji’s wife & a sevadar </font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">syvwdwr </font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">of the highest eminence). </font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">Sangat Ji, this is just a way of demonstrating that young Sikhs and Sikh girls especially associate the notion of </font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>girl-power</em></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"> with female soldiers, warriors, and group leaders etc. In short, they associate </font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>girl-power</em></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"> with roles that were traditionally given to men. As females we think that in order to be considered equals in a male-dominant society, we need to show competence in the same fields as men: i.e. demonstrate the ability to fight in battle, being group leaders, and being the alpha-dog etc. Many girls in western society believe that fulfilling traditional female roles are demeaning: i.e. Rearing children, providing guidance for family members, cooking for the family, and completing house-hold chores etc. </font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">I would like to ask: </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in" align="center">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>Are the women who stayed home and raised their children less heroic than those that went to battle & fought alongside the Singhs?</em></font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">It’s my humble belief that a Sikh woman’s ultimate seva (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">syvw</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">)to the panth is raising her children to be complete Gurmukhs and provide support and guidance to members of her home. Although I firmly believe that if they were ever called upon the daugthers of the panth would lead for Sikhi and bleed for Sikhi, we must realize that Sikh mothers have a role in protecting our traditions that no other member of our nation has. </font>

  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">These lines ** (from this essay not the url) have been cited many times in our history to instruct expecting mothers about their duty to prepare their children to be guruwale (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">gurU vwly</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">). </font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">Devoting time to teaching their children about Sikhi is a seva which is taken very lightly by modern Sikh women. The progression of a pure Sikh tradition without the compromise of our rehat (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">rihq</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">) is being challenged by the forces of western culture, media, fashion and thought. While the latter influences are shaping our generation on a daily basis in our schools, work places, and television, we are struggling to instill a sense of pride and confidence in our youth. We could meet this challenge by properly educating our youngsters in our very own homes, through our children’s first educator: our mothers. Along with nourishing her child’s body with food, a mother can nourish her child’s mind through the narration of stories from our marvelous Sikh history, teaching them to read gurmukhi(</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">gurmuKI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">), to learn santhiya (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">gurbwxI jI dI sMiQAw</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">), to become proficient in understanding bani (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">gurbwxI jI dy ArQ</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">), and doing simran (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">ismrn</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">). </font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">The lack of knowledge and regard that Punjabi youth have toward the Sikh way of life may be substantially reduced if Sikh mothers would educate their children and raise them on the ideals of Sikhi. This is not to say that all problems owing to generations of “Sikhi-less-ness” falls on the shoulders of Sikh mothers, but this is surely one of the greatest fields pertaining to the chardi kala (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">cVHdI klw</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">) of the future of our panth.</font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">This leads into another issue in Sikh society which was briefly touched upon earlier in this paper: Gender inequality. As the Chinese proverb states </font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in" align="center">
  “<font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>A gardener who does not guard his flowers from looming weeds, will one day find his garden being choked of its livelihood.”</em></font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">Many of the problems within the Sikh nation are stemming from our inability to deal with our own problems as they come up. For some time now sentiments of feeling unappreciated, feeling inferior, and not feeling respected have been settling into the hearts of Sikh women, owing to an inability of Sikh men to realize a woman’s worth. Keeping this in mind, young women are trying to earn their respect through acquiring an attitude and an image consistent with the notion of “</font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>girl-power</em></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">.” Women are subconsciously placing less importance on familial duties and more importance on taking on “male-roles” in order to achieve equal status & stature. This trend can be illustrated by observing the appearance of aspiring female leaders in the corporate world. Female presidents, and CEOs as well as women who are trying to reach such posts often have short hair (boy-cuts) and wear blazers & dress pants; the image of a man in the corporate world. By comparison female employees or secretaries often have long hair and wear dress skirts. </font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">My aim is not to critique this ideology of “</font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>girl-power</em></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">” in Sikhi, but to show what this attitude has caused. It’s been my experience that Amritdhari (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">AMimRqDwrI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">) people, but especially amritdhari girls tend to alienate non-amritdhari Punjabis. My parents are amritdhari, but growing up they never enforced or encouraged my sisters and I to keep a complete Sikhi saroop (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">is~KI srUp</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">). We learned to read bani (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">bwxI pVnI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">), speak Punjabi, and to guard our honor as women (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">lwj r~KxI</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">). Like many Punjabi parents, my parents didn’t want their girls to feel left out of American society. So although we were “Sikhs on the inside” (even though such a thing cannot truly exist), we were not Sikhs on the outside. I believe that the outer appearance of a Sikh is as important as the inner aspect, but I have met </font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><strong>MANY</strong></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">, people who adorn the Sikhi saroop, but are void of Gurmat (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">gurmq</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">) on the inside.</font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">Sangat Ji, I regret to admit that there have been many times when I felt discriminated against by my amritdhari sisters for trimming my eyebrows or wearing skirts. Although I admire amritdhari people for keeping a Sikhi saroop & lifestyle, many of them tend to be intimidating and selective, which is why I never had meaningful friendships with them. And although my parents were amritdhari and I was aware of Rehat and Amrit, I never completely felt that I would commit to a life of an amritdhari Sikh until I had a wonderful experience with the sangat at my last university. One Singh’s mannerism in particular had a lasting impression on me and many others at my school. I was not surprised at all to learn that the reason he was such a great Sikh was largely due to the way his mother raised him. His elderly Ustad (</font><font face="GurbaniAkharThick"><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">bjurg ausqwd</font></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">) in Toronto and his sangat also had a large role in the shaping of his Faith, but he explains that his foundation and strength in Sikhi was unquestionably from his mother’s teachings. I have seen other examples of Gurmukhs who are a shining reminder of what a Sikh should be, and those Singhs and Kaurs are also products of fantastic child rearing. </font>

We have the tools with which we can remedy many of our own problems. It’s the aim of many panthic well-wishers to reshape the way we treat each other. The threats that Sikhi faces demand us to be more sincere and dear to each other. We need to feel that each man, woman and child in our panth is precious. I think this realization only starts to take effect if each Sikh considers the next person to be more valuable than his/her self.</font>

  <font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">I didn’t write this paper to simply “</font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"><em>give my two-cents</em></font><font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3">,” because I believe my opinion isn’t of any importance. I wrote this article because I thought it was of interest to my fellow Gursikhs. I’m bound to offend some readers and make errors in trying to express my views. For that I apologize and hope that I did not hurt anyone’s feelings. It took me a long time to decide how I was going to express my opinion simply because I was very cautious of upsetting any Gurmukhs. Even though I was careful in the selection of my words I know that I cannot control how the sangat will react, as those are matters that I will leave in God’s hands.</font>
