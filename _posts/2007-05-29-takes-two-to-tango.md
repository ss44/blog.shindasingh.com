So here we are almost two weeks later and the situation in Punjab with the dera is still volatile as ever. Although calm has taken its course over the last week, the whole drama still has many anxiously sitting at the edge's of their seats, waiting to see what the next move is. Like a game of chess every one's eyes are now on the board and it's the Panths turn to make its play, after the Baba released his devious "apology" in the last turn. The idleness keeps the minds searching, keeping it analyzing every possible move, keeping a look out for those nefarious angles the whole time trying to grip and make sense of what's happening, the reason and logic behind the madness.

As always I continue to see this as less of a religious or panthic situation, rather a political tango between India's Capulet's and the Montague's with the Panth being held captive in between. This has little to do with ones own faith rather the manipulation of that faith for something of its ones own desires. If nothing else a glaring result as to why the Panth should remain independent of any political party and remain independent as the permanent opposition of Punjab, for its only in its own independence can it remain objective.

The last angle focused completely on Badal, him being the puppet master, the ring leader of this fiasco, but as Harp notably pointed out that their are inherit flaws with that frame of logic, after all it takes two to tango, and that being the case one needs to consider an angle with more then just one ring leader. So lets do just that, lets add in more angles more actors and check the path it leads.

Quick Review:

  * The Akali's blame the Dera for his strong hold and clout on the Malwa region, which saw them loose some top seats in the past elections.
  * The Dera put its weight behind the Congress the long sworn enemies of the Akali Dal.
  * The Dera is centered in Sirsa located in Haryana and thus out of the Akali's jurisdiction.
  * Haryana's government is Congress, and being boys with the Dera got his back.
  * SGPC and Sri Akal Takhat are greatly influenced by Akali's and Badal.

There should be little doubt as to what Badal and them want to gain from this, by raising up hell against the Dera there is the plausible chance that his grip over the Malwa region will slip, giving the Akalis a better chance in the region next time around. But see a war against the Dera naturally ensues a war against Congress after all what type of friend lets another go at it alone. There are inherit questions that one needs to ask: who fed the news to the media to get it pushed and make it "news". See the Dera released the ad's, but why?Â  There's no doubt that the Akali's wanted to deal with the Dera, but I doubt that this was the way they had in mind. So where did the dera gain the fortitude to be so bold in its actions, which I accredit to the older cousin theory; that when one knows that they got older cousins behind them who are down for ruckus, then by virtue that younger cousin gets a little ballsy.

There's no question about the Indian media's loyalties and its history to take a story and sensationalize it, twist it, manipulate it, without any shame when it comes to the regard of spearheading a campaign of propaganda and the news reports that have been coming out of this fiasco prove this point. The news is both hook and bait, on one end its saying, "so what you going do about it", taunting the Sikhs to take action against the dera, and on the other "look at what you did", as if the reaction was out of the blue and totally unforeseen. This plays well to the congress since it now agitates a community within Punjab that everyone has tried to keep dormant for so long, what the media has come to dub, "Sikh militancy groups".

The thing with Sikh Nationalists that's worth keeping in mind is that at least seemingly, they despise Badal and the current Akali's, they also despise Congress and for them it's not a matter of power as much as it is of Independence and the freedom of the Akal Takhat and the Sikh faith. To this regard, pushing them only knows one end, and that's to be pushed back, which of course is what Congress would love to see happen. Once you push this group then the Congress has only but to slip back into Haryana and seeing how this is a Punjab problem leaves Badal to deal with an agitated group who is willing to go at it. Now Badal's left to deal and take charge against the same people who he is supposed to represent, if not directly then at least through the SGPC and the voice of the Akal Takhat.

Now look at the past events, taking the Dera and the Congress to be one and the same, we see how both have helped to agitate this situation. Same time Badal and his BJP cronies have done what they can to reveal a sound level of diplomacy, (the Swami was from the pockets of the BJP). So it leaves the problematic play in the hands of Badal yet again. If the Akal Takhat rejects the apology then we can assume chaos will ensue with riots similar to that of the weeks past, leaving Badal to quell the situation, which could hurt him politically. Accepting the apology leaves Badal vulnerable to attack by the Nationalists as it would see Badal siding with the Dera, which again brings the potential to have riots start up all over Punjab. Therefore leaving the only real play Badal can make is to get the SGPC and Akal Takhat to reject the apology yet grant an extension to the dera so that diplomacy can ensue, which could show a weakness on the part of the Sikhs, yet would buy Badal and group, more time to deal with the situation.

Now Congress's angle in this would be that getting riots to ensue and by putting Badal in the hot seat, they could then react on a federal level, where congress reigns supreme, and voice that presidents rule be implemented in Punjab, effectively throwing out the Akalis and putting power and Punjab into the hands of the Congress party. They could then continue to feed and ride the Punjab situation for as long as they need effectively kicking Badal and company to the curb.

Of course this is all speculation, but lets face it nothing about this situation adds up. End of the day, both parties Congress and the Akali's are merely separate sides to the same coin, but it remains that neither truley have the Panths welfare at the heart of any of there decisions, so it's up to the Panth to dictate and exert there own level of leadership to find a way out of this situation.
