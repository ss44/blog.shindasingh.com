If you ever thought or felt that Sikhi in Toronto was on a downhill, with all the Committee problems, increased number of Amrtidharis dating, people starting to take Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji to halls, and all that other stuff, then I guess you can take comfort in knowing that we're FAAAAAAAAAAAR behind UK when it comes to Gurdwara mismanagement and its problems.

Although its not something to be all that proud of, considering the fact that Beadbi is going on, in a way its somewhat reassuring that there is some level of moral, ethical sense in regards to how Sikhi is practiced and preached.

I think UK's a perfect example of what happens when you let the Jhajaroo spirit slide for just a minute. You leave the door open for these types of idiots. Peep the video and see for yourself.

> This video highlights the amount of disrespect of Guru Ji currently taking place at the Ek Niwas Institute in Wolverhampton. This has been going on for a long time. Action must be taken now.
