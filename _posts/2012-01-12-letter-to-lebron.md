**Dear LeBron,**

Contrary to popular belief the world does not hate you.

It's actually quite the opposite.

We want you to succeed.

We want you to win.

We want you to tap into that unlimited potential you possess.

We want you to dominate every moment you're on the court.

We want you to be ruthless.

We want you to be the greatest of all time.

But when you continuously fail to show up in the fourth quarter, you disappoint us.

You're cheating us LeBron. You're cheating greatness. You're cheating yourself.

From all accounts you're a great guy. A great human being. A genuinely nice person.

But we don't know you LeBron. You're not our friend. You're a professional basketball player.

We pay to watch you do one thing. Play basketball. In all four quarters.

And right now, we're getting a 75% return on our investment.

This is why we love Kobe. This is why we loved Michael. This is why we're in love with KD.

We don't care about their personalities. We care about their basketball abilities.

We care about them dominating every moment they're on the court.

We care about them maximizing every iota of potential they have.

And we want you to do the same LeBron. Maximize your potential.

We want you to hit the 3 at the end of the game. We want you to dominate in the post.

We want you to dunk over everyone. We want you to win, win, win and win some more.

Don't get confused LeBron. We're not mad, we're just disappointed.
