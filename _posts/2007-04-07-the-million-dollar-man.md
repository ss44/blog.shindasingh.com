It seems that only two type of people win the lottery those who don't need it, and those who are about to die. So goes the case for the latest lottery winner who I happen to have met and gotten to know in my stint at Ottawa, none other Balz'y's own cousin, Inderpal. I guess Inderpal falls into the, "doesn't really need it" category but then again a few extra mill never really hurt anyone, except for maybe all the people who have been killed all over the mighty dollar, but thats neither here nor there. Luckily enough Mr. Bal was gracious enough to spread his winnings with all his boys in Ottawa, which is pure reason to be vexed since I decided not to return the last year, seeing as how it would paid itself off. Whatever, time to find Ranjit and hustle him for whatever cut he got, after all vice president of CISA has to earn him something, if it doesn't then Ranjit Sion its all in vain. But anyways, congratulations to Indy on his winnings and now that he's looking to put a down payment on that house on the hill don't forget those of us still living in the valley's, after all a post about you being loaded should earn me a nice ride if anything else.
