    So yesterday was the big anti war protest, that took place across various cities around the world. Ottawa wasn't near as big as Toronto or other cities with an estimated turn out of 80-200 people. (Those are the numbers from the papers).

    At the end when everyone got together at Parliment, there were some other groups there raising awareness for their human rights causes, which reminded me of SS's advice of using these protests to bring awareness to our own cause. Maybe next time print of 500 handouts about Prof. Davinderpal Singh and hand those out? May not get him free, but at least it'll let him be known.
