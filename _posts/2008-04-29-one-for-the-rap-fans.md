Looks like [Sarpanch Sion](http://pindgagan.com) and company got recognized up on [RealGM](http://www.realgm.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=785113), the Toronto Sun and Vakeeel Sahib's very own [lobby group (FireSamMitchell.com).](http://firesammitchell.com/intensity/#comments)

Got to hand it to sarpanch sahib and his pind for making The Toronto Star and Global TV last year, and and Sun this year. Seems like the Pindu's are making a real go at Bhatia's super fan status.
