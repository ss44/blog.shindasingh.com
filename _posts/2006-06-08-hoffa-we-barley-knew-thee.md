Rafeal Arujo, the Raptors (Babcocks) first round pick a few years back, finally ended his tenure today with the Raptors, after being dealt to the Utah Jazz.

Surprisingly we got two guys for him (Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley) leaving many to wonder if we got ripped off (how do you give away two guys of Hoffa of all people), but then again Hoffa's stay in Toronto was as painful to watch, as watching one of those PETA videos, but you can only hope that he found a better home.

Now to describe Hoffa's tenure with the Raptors isn't hard, but rather then talk and write about it, I feel this video sums up his abilities, and why the fans felt the way they did about him.
