Gosh darn it, them Muslims&nbsp;are at it again, this time around though they're pissed off at Pope Bendadict and the catholic clergy, after the Pope quoted an old text talking about how the religion of Mohammad aka Islam, being a religion so relentless in its pursuit of world domination that it's either Islam or death, (sounds kind of familiar). [Mind you that the Pope was lecturing against the ideology of the person who said the quote and was using the quote as a reference as a point to his entire lecture,&nbsp;but **that**&nbsp;is irrelevant] 

Undoubtedly this pissed off Muslims as they figure that the Pope called _the_ prophet Mohammad a terrorist, which as you would expect would bring about the chaos that has ensued, but in the end are they not [our Muslim brethren] proving the quote true, by reacting to a quote that said, Muslims are violent, with violence?

Now don't get me wrong, if I were Muslim, which according to the religious quiz on quizfarm.com I am, I'd probably be pissed of to, but then again that doesn't make it right, let alone justify the&nbsp;violence, or threats of&nbsp;it.&nbsp;

History doesn't seem to recall any&nbsp;outbursts, which brings to&nbsp;question why not. Off course there was the opposition against Gandhi, and I'm sure there were even protests, but seemingly those are lost&nbsp;in the&nbsp;footnotes&nbsp;of some history textbooks.

Fair enough, we're bigger then that and got thicker skin then the Muslims, but didn't Gandhi's remarks not warrant widespread rage? After all, he wouldn't have been around to get his beatings from the British if it wasn't for Sri Guru Tegh Bahadaur Sahib Ji taking a stand or Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji who sacrificed his entire family giving Gandhi the opportunity to become the akirat kan that he was..

Unlike the Muslims we had a _legitimate_ beef, yet we chose to take the road less traveled, the turn the other cheek and keep marching&nbsp;approach.&nbsp;The approach that led us to&nbsp;bare the brunt of the sticks and stones handed out back in those days by the British, letting not Gandhi's words hurt us.&nbsp;

It's that swallowing of pride that finds a way to get under my skin and boil into the sheer annoyance that I am&nbsp; starting to develop against&nbsp;Muslims. Although I may respect there gonads when it comes to&nbsp;protesting collectively the way they do, the fact that they do it over the stupidest things is starting to lead me to resent them. They demand equal rights in secular nations yet fail to give the same rights back in their own. They openly denounce all religions day in day out, yet throw a fit when someone talks&nbsp;or even questions&nbsp;Islam. They are furious over the worlds negative portrayal of&nbsp;Muslims yet they do nothing to help make us think otherwise, and yet they some how day in and day out seem to justify there own hypocrisy, while denouncing all others.
