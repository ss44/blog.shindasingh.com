Ever since his designation as India's PM, I've always been sceptical of Manmohan Singhs abilities to really serve the Sikh community. While many jumped and continue to jump with joy thinking that in some perverted way we have once again achieved Khalsa Raaj I can only continue to shake my head at the blind ignorance shown by our people.

I was going around the net and came across something written by, Omali Yeshitela who is a prominent figure and passionate speaker in the continuing civil rights movement in the US, which I feel really sums up whats happening today to Sikhs in India, and even across the world. The speech is from one of his works titled, _Resistance of African People, Crisis of Imperialism: Why We must Build the National People's Democratic Uhuru Movement._

I included the live audio portion which was copped from the Dead Prez intro, and a copy of the written speech that I copped from this other [mans blog](http://hashman.spaces.msn.com/blog/cns!83CAB100E2113290!217.entry).

> I'm told the Native People in the Arctic, in order to kill wolves take a sharp knife, melt the ice, and bury the handle in the ice and let it freeze over with the blade projecting up. They would cover the blade with blood. Wolves would smell the blade and come to try to eat. They would lick the blade. When they licked the blade they would cut their tongues and they would drink their own blood. They really were thinking that they had a lot to eat then, and of course they were drinking their own blood and killing themselves in the process.

One thing though that I do question though is how much of it is the oppressed (the wolves fault). Where Yeshitela blames the oppressor for everything, which is understandable, but there comes a time when the wolf needs to take responsibility. The first time sure, we were. (it [the wolf] was), ignorant about what was happening, but after everything that's happened and to still remain ignorant crosses over into the realm of stupidity. We need to take more responsibility for our actions but convincing others about being this ignorant has proved to be no easy task. After all how do you convince the other wolves who continue to lick the blade, that its no good, considering they can bare witness to the hundreds of dead wolves around them. This problem stems into so many different branch's in Sikhi, there are so many different blades that we continue to cut ourselves with, yet even after realization of this self mutilation we continue on, and keep repeating the same mistakes of yesterday, and then wonder why things got this way.

It all comes back to learning from our history, which no one seems ready to do. Thus repeating the same mistakes that we vowed to never let happen again happen right under our watch. So much for least we forget. I can understand the whole moving forward concept, but how can one move forward until the pains of yesterday have yet to be acknowledged. Basically,

The past, for better or worse is a shadow that gets longer as the day goes on. It follows our every footstep and though we may forget that we have a shadow it nonetheless is behind us every step we take. No matter how far we run or how far we go, there will always be a shadow looming and following, always one step behind so that if we happen to look back we will be forced to remember or we can choose to forget.</span></span></span>
