Ghagga and his associates for their mis-parchar against the Sikh Nation.</p> 

<p>
  The sandesh signed by Jathedar Joginder Singh Vedanti, has ordered a boycott of Inder S Ghagga, Gurcharan S Jeeonwala, Manjit S Sihota, Karamjit S Gill,  Amandeep S Kang, Gurmit Sinh, Parminder S Parmar, and Jasbir S Mangat, and banned them from utilizing any Panthic stage or platform.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, they have been asked Ghagga to stop his anti-Sikh propaganda, appear before Sri Akal Takht Sahib and ask for public forgiveness. Until then, the Sikh Sangat is instructed to continue the ban against these individuals.
