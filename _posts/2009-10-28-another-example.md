Before I start, I just want to thank God. I want to thank God for providing me with such great material to post on this blog. I want to thank God for the internet. I want to thank God for giving me such a venue to bring the world's atrocities to the forefront of this blog. And I want to thank God for all the viewers and readers out there, without you this isn't possible. See I know how to look out for the people.

I saw this video a few days ago and while in my heart I knew that it was a female driving I had no real proof and therefore I didn't want to post it without any proof. But thanks to the internet and thestar.com, I am able to do so.



From that video you can not tell it's a woman even though you know it is. However, today thestar.com came out with the following story:

>     The driver of the BMW SUV X5 in the Extreme Fitness lot pulled into a space and kept going, up and over two parked cars. One of them belongs to Todd Jamison, systems administrator at the gym, whose voice shook Wednesday when he described how his car was destroyed. The other reportedly was a rental car.

>     "It sort of sucks," he said. The rogue vehicle backed off Jamison's 2004 Hyundai Elantra and another car, then stopped, paused, backed out of the space and drove slowly out of the lot. The footage, which aired locally on CP24, can be viewed here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do6pmYfNco0" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do6pmYfNco0</a>.

I don't go out of my way to bring you stories about bad female drivers. They just come to me. Consider this this weeks confessions of a female driver. She even went as far as to give us a video of her exploits.

"You certainly don't see that everyday."

I beg to differ. I see that a lot more than I would like to.
