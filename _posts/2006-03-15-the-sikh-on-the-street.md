Came across this video (posted below) while I was waiting to write my exam. Got to give it to Sartaj for this one, it was good looking out the way he came up with the whole idea and concept behind this video. Watch the video first and then read below if you want for my review and take on things. (Videos about 10 minutes long, may take some time to load).



Now I could write a long review about it, but what more needs to be said. I think we have made huge in roads in the last little while, with everyone doing their bit to contribute, with each generation offering and doing what it could.

  * The elder generation set up the Gurdwara's all around, (sure they also created a bunch of conflicts), which sooner or later will be in our hands to manage and take care of.
  * The generation after them fought some of the first Kirpan and turban cases in many of our urban area's, (Toronto anyways)
  * Then the generation after them started to create awareness in schools and universities, setting up SSA's, etc..
  * The next in line started the youth camps.
  * And the ones after them (I guess you could say the current), went crazy on the internet and created an internet presence.

We can only wait and see to find out what's comes next, I'm guessing athletics, I'm talking about main stream sports, because like Rapheal once said, "Nobody understands cricket! You gotta know what a crumpet is to understand cricket".

Anyways there's another video he did that was also nice, and I'll post that one tomorrow, because after all, you already wasted enough time reading this, and watching the video so now you can get back to studying, reading bani, or whatever else it was that you were doing before you took a minute out of your day to come here to see if I said anything outrageous, ridiculous, or just plain out stupid.
