Anyone who watched Shamrock vs Ortiz 2 knows that Shamrock got robbed with the fight getting cut short. Sure enough Ortiz probably would have won, but cutting the fight that short, after only 3-4 uncontested punch's, was definitely uncalled for. It's in fights like that, that make you wish that UFC was a little more liberal in when it chooses to stop fights. Check out this clip I came across from Hero another MMA fighting league.

  Now undoubtedly the impact of these blows is much less then the impact left by some of the top UFC fighters so letting that many punches go undefended would definitely leave some sort of mark, nonetheless it goes to make one entertaining bout, with all the twists and turns of a fixed wrestling match.
