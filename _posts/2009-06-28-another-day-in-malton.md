> Emergency crews were called to Monica Dr. near Goreway Rd. in Mississauga's Malton community after they received several reports of shots being fired.
> 
> When they arrived, officers found a man suffering from an "undisclosed number of gunshot wounds," said Const. Adam Minnion.
> 
> He was rushed to Etobicoke General Hospital in critical condition but was later pronounced dead.
> 
> Homicide investigators continued to investigate the scene this morning.
> 
> No arrests have been made and no suspect descriptions have been released.
> 
> There were plenty of people at the party and many fled before police had a chance to speak to them, said Minnion, who is appealing for those potential witnesses to come forward.
> 
> Even if you do not think you saw anything important, it could be a key part of the investigation, Minnion said.
> 
> Despite reports that several shots were fired, Minnion said there is no evidence at the moment to suggest there was more than one victim.
> 
> The death marks Peel's 13th homicide of the year.
> 
> The victim's identity will not be released until family members are notified.
> 
> In November 2007, 23-year-old David Latchana was gunned down at "Paulette's Place," a booze can on the same street as Sunday's shooting. Police have not been able to confirm whether the shooting happened at the same place.
> 
> Anyone with information is asked to call homicide detectives at 905-453-2121 ext. 3205.
