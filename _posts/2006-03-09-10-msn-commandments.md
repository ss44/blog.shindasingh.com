If any of you are forum goers, then you probably know about this whole beef going on with [Amanpreet](http://www.sikhsangat.com/index.php?showtopic=17370) and some [Concerned Individuals](http://www.concerned-individuals.blogspot.com/). For those who dont know the just of the story, is that Amanpreet is the man behind a few popular Sikhi Websites and he got booked doing/saying things that are not appropriate for a Singh. Apparently Singhs approached Amanpreet, but he decided to make things a public issue and well that only backfired on him when the other side aired him out by making their own website against him.

<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.buildspace.co.uk/pjslife/images/index/msn.gif" />Now I dont know Amanpreet, so I wont go into the whole issue, other then the fact that at its base seems to be the ever so popular MSN Messenger. Now Amanpreets not the first to get booked. There have been other Singhs who got put into similar situations, such as Jatinder who got faded not so long ago, Manjit whos now facing criminal charges for the things hes done, even most the fights I got into back in High School came courtesy of these chat programs. Many people back in the Turner days also got screwed, when almost every desis ICQ history went public, and once people learned about Key Loggers, well lets just say that hell froze over for many.

Realizing that no ones perfect, and that everyones has their faults, I write this in an attempt to help many you youngins protect yourselves, from making similar mistakes that many others have made throughout the ages. I thought Id share whatever giaan I had on this topic, (considering I was around since ICQ first dropped, and been alive throughout the entire MSN, Yahoo, AIM revolution).

So I humbly present to all my Singhs, (Bibian you can use this advice too, just relate all the parts about Bibian to Singhs instead):

**The 10 MSN Commandments. (You can apply this to other IMs also)**

**Rule #1** 
  
Dont add Bibian looking to start a relationship or get close. Unless you got a plan, be a man and do the right thing (Dont add them with future hopes).

**Rule #2**
  
Now listen close, because this one really gets ya, dont add random people trying to make your list grow, because by now you should know, that the bigger your list the more people you got that can potentially screw you. (Dont add people unless they add you first, is always a good thing to live by).

**Rule #3**
  
I think should have been number 1, but if a Bibi says she loves ya, then drop everything and run. Dont stand still, because that shit always comes back to haunt you, and thats just never any fun. A Bibi whose jonzed is as bad as aids, youre just asking to get screwed over. Keep your kashera on tight boys, this rule you must remember.

**Rule #4**
  
Is often overlooked, but if someones acting bad, that mans probably shook. Dont fight, never start internet beefs, block them cowards and give them a time and place that you can meet.

**Rule #5**
  
Be weary of strangers. More often then not random people who add you and spend hours talking to you often have other interests in mind, so be smart and pay attention and keep the things you say, in line.

**Rule #6**
  
Your msn list isn't protected. Use protection and caution when you let your fingers speak. Last thing you want and need are your convo's being shown to the world, and having the complete internet thinking youre half of a man with his tail between his legs, chasing after girls.

**Rule #7**
  
Be smart with what you say and to whom, copy and pasting isn't hard. Most people can copy and paste faster then they can type.

**Rule #8**
  
Is my favourite, I follow this one real close, when mans send you files, never accept unless you know that their safe. Your foes can be disguised as friends, so like Yoda, precaution you must take.

**Rule #9**
  
Watch the links that people send. Unless they tell you what their sending, dont click it. At the very least make sure that they know their sending you a link. Dont click on it first and ask questions later, because by then it could be too late, for both you and your computer.

**Rule #10**
  
Realize that your MSNs always tapped. If its really important and you want to keep conversations private then tell your mans to call you or better yet discuss things when you meet up in person.

Now there are a few other tips that you should always remember such as its not wrong to block people. If someone gets annoying block them someone starts jonzing block them, someone says something stupid, block them. This feature is so highly underrated, yet can save you so many head aches.

Now follow these rules, and unlike others you may just be safe. For all you Singhs, if you cant show your conversation to the panj pyarai without feeling guilty, then thats a conversation you shouldnt be having.

Now if you felt like I wasted your time, then you should have been smart enough to stop reading ages ago. If youre offended by things I may have said, then theres not much I can do for you.

So till next time,

Keep fit, and have fun..
