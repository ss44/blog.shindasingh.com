For those who haven't heard yet UFC bought out Pride today for an estimated 70 million US, monopolizing its hold on the&nbsp;MMA fight scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the news is to be&nbsp;somewhat reminiscent of when WWF (screw the E)&nbsp;bought WCW back in the glory days of Wrestling, then I guess that would make the IFL&nbsp;the TNA, in UFC's back side. 

Although this now makes UFC vs Pride dream fights possible, it also&nbsp;brings about changes to&nbsp;Pride's rules, i.e banning the use of stomping and knee's while on the ground.&nbsp;Either way it's&nbsp;still good news for the sport, and I can't wait to see the Superbowl of UFC / Pride fighting. The news is best when you think about fighters like Anderson Silva, GSP and even possibly Liddell&nbsp;who&nbsp;seemingly are&nbsp;above and beyond most other fighters in their respected weight classes finally getting some better competition.&nbsp;Hopefully this change will help keep all these fighters on their toes, and bring about some historic match ups in the near future.

Anyways for more info on the merger check&nbsp;out&nbsp;[ESPN](http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/news/story?id=2814235),&nbsp;[Sherdog](http://www.sherdog.com/)&nbsp;or the [official UFC site](http://www.ufc.com/), and hopefully [Bhagauti](http://bhagauti.blogspot.com) will have something more insightful to say about the merger.
