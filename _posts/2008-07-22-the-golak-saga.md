  About a month back news broke around these parts about a damaging video that came out of Glidden Gurdwara. The story was basically a raagi staying at the Guru Ghar booked one of the committee members pocketing money from out of the golak. In light of this the next time the committee got together to presumably do the seva of cleaning out the golak and organizing the change, he [Raagi Singh] went all Mission Impossible and video taped the entire incident.

  Anyways turns out the video got put on youtube where it's since been collecting hits and furthering the tale. Surprisingly the video isn't as breaking news, as I was originally lead to believe, and instead has been sitting around for 2 years before it managed to resurface. Whether its surfacing was part of a grander scheme on the part of a black mailer turned righteous do-gooder (we seem to have a lot of those in our Quam), or nothing more then mud that is being slung by opposing committees, is better left to those inÂ  the know, and actual journalists to uncover and reveal.

  For the rest of us there's only mindless speculation on what could be / is happening and echoing the same old rhetoric that we've become so accustomed to:
</p>

  * We need to take the gurdwara away from these masands
  * Where did all the Singhs of Guru Gobind Singh go, who let such actions happen??
  * Why hasn't there been a morchaa against such individuals and committee's!!
  * Where are our youth!!?!?!
  * Is this what Gursikhi has come down to??
  * What about the children, will somebody please think about the children!!

Anyways, the video's posted below and I'm not sure what to make of it just yet since its not in the bright vivid HD quality I've come to enjoy. Also having half dazedly watched it once, I never really picked up on at what point the crime takes place. For those looking for more details, the original site that had the video on display (a pro Afghanna/Ghagga site) had this to share:-

> This movie is of a Golak Chor who is stealing the money from the Golak at the time of counting at Sri Guru Nanak Sikh Center, Glidden Road, Brampton, Canada. Golak Chor Devinder Chhokar was a president of the Gurdwara at the time he was stealing money. It is believed that he stole the money for last 5-6 years and it was discovered in middle of 2006, when a young parcharak made this video through the roof opening. Chhokar has other associates in the Gurdwara committee, who are defending him to date and want to get rid of those from the committee who are opposing to the Golak Chori.

And without further ado the video at the center of all this hub bub -

  <em>Also noting the time shown when the videos being shot, its nice to see our commitees taking in an interest in being up during amrit velaa to do such sevaa, assuming off course the timer on the video is right.</em>
