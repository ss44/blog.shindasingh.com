I came back home to Brampton Wednesday night, and after a few days of settling in and checking up with everyone, its time to let the fact that an election is taking place settle in.

For the most part this election seems quite tame, espiecially in contrast to those of the past. Driving around I've yet to see the streets and house lawns coloured in the various red and blue, liberal / conservative signs of elections past. The fact that this is a winter election taking place during the holidays may have something to do with this.

Being out of the mix for the last 4 months its fair to say that I have had little clue to whats going on, at the local level, let alone policy wise at the party level, just because I havn't been having my daily dose of CPAC and CBC Newsworld, while being away in Ottawa (ironically).

So lets recap whats happening, and even look at some of the candidates running, especially those that most of you reading this are familiar with.

Lets start with [Nav Bains](http://www.navdeepbains.ca/). Word so far is that as suspected he's hanging onto his korsee by a [<img width="130" height="97" border="0" align="left" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/img8-729950.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/img8-733381.jpg)thread. Now thats come to be expected considering Bains turned his back or seemingly turned his back on his community, and dharm, when he went against Vedanti and the Akaal Takhat and took a stand to legalize Gay Marriage. Pile that to the other things that occured in his past term,

  * Ashotoush support letter (he did apologize and plead ignorant to not knowing who he was writing the letter for)
  * Matha Teking at Gandhis Grave (said that this didn't happen, and that the media is sensationalizing the incident)

and you can expect that those who helped him get elected the first term, dont want anything to do with him now.

Now Nav's a nice guy, I knew him (well from afar anyways) growing up, and his family, and he is well Mr. Nice Guy, but this is politics and nice will only take you so far.

Although I may disagree with him on his actions, I still find that going against him as the community has is quite short sighted. Way I see it, we finally got an Amrtidhari Singh in the house, we should now support him, espeically with this shakey government, so that he can quickly climb ranks as he aready has shown capable of doing. Although its fair to disagree with his actions, until we get another qualified Singh or Singhni in to the political circle (Mr. Chardi Kalaa this means you), I think we have to make do with what we got.

After all end of the day, I'm sure Nav will be more swayed to deal with Panthic events then Mr. Sandhu (clean cut and shaven) will.

But then again maybe this is just politics, where neither candidates Nav or Mr. Sandhu can be trusted. But then again maybe its just me, but I'd rather have Nav represent then Sandhu any day of the weak. Its almost like choosing the better of the two evils.

End of the day, I still think that Navl has the greater potential to do good, and has a greater chance to become a Minister, then anyone else.

So lets see if Nav can pull it of. He has the volunteers, although it seems very few of them are from his home riding, or so at least its rumored. If Nav can get the community behind him, and regain the trust of the various sikh groups in the area outside of WSO, I'm sure he can muster the support he needs to beat Sandhu.

Hopefully he's learned some lessons from all this. The two ways I see Nav getting back into this, [(Globe and Mail reported him being in trouble of being ousted this time around)](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051223/SAMESEX23/TPNational/?query=Navdeep+Bains) is by:

  1. Apologizing, for the actions which offended the community.
  2. Talk about long term goals that only he can accomplish by being the first Amritdhari Sikh in the house.

Although Nav comes from what I've known to be a Gurmat oriented up bringing, I figure if he had a better understanding of Gurbani, he would easily be able to sway the Sangat and reach the Sangat when it came to vocalizing his stance on certain issues.

But then again thats just my 2 cents.
