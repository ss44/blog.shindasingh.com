Post 9/11 attacks against Sikhs and Guru Ghars, became a common headline. Living comfortably in the punjabi ghettos of Brampton, Malton, Rexdale, Surrey etc. its often hard to connect and or even relate to the racist environment many Sikhs live in these days. Sure our parents went through it when they themselves were starting out here, but for the most part we've become established, which leads us to feel the way [Bhagauti Soora](http://bhagauti.blogspot.com/2006/05/canadian-dastaar-in-cali.html) does, that here in Canada we are not looked at differently.

Truth is, that we probably are but living in our ghettos, our safe havens, we don't face it or get exposed to it on an ongoing basis as those who live in the small rural communities where they really are the minority.

Anyways this truth didn't really hit home till last week when I went up to the Nagar Kirtan in Montreal. Like I said in my last post the Nagar Kirtan was awsome, but the real surprise came after when we where entering the Gurdwara Sahib and walked past one of the Gurdwara Side walls that had racist insignia pasted over it.

For the first time, since I was in elementary had I seen such blatant acts of racism. Whats even more disturbing though is the lack of "coverage". Now I like to think that I'm up to date with the events going on within the community. I read most Sikh news sources (Sikhnet, Panthic, and SikhSangat), follow the main headlines in the Punjabi news papers (Ajit, Hamdard, Sanjh Savera), and I usually look at the [Toronto Star](http://www.thestar.com) headlines on a pretty daily basis, so its safe to say that when something big happens I'll read about it from somewhere.

But, for some reason or another I never heard about any attacks against any Gurdwara Sahibs in Montreal. I know that Jewish synagogues had been attacked and spray painted on a year or two back. That some Muslims mosques had been vandalized but nothing ever about any Gurdwara in Montreal, and that included our Punjabi, and online news sources.

So when in doubt I did what we all tend to do, I turned to google. Again. I tried searching "Gurdwara Attack Montreal". "Montreal Sikh Temple", "Sikh Temple Vandalized", "Sikh Nazi", and a combination of those, and still came up short. Chullo Google isn't perfect so I went on Canadian Newsstand, a database of all the Newspaper articles published in Canadian Newspapers, and again tried a combination of searches and still nothing, leading me to believe that no one ever reported or even mentioned that the Gurdwara's had been vandalized to anyone, which pretty much surprised me, since as a community we tend to report everything.

Anyways, there's not much else to say. The group who did it, clearly let it be known who they are, _New Age Skins_, and I doubt are hard people to find. Its surprising though as to how we can go at it with each other till our we're all left blind (an eye for an eye), but you'd think that when things like that happen in Montreal, we'd at least regroup as a community to help out.

Anyways, enough on that, Guru Sahib Kirpaa Karn.
