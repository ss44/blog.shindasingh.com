Thanks to Harp who linked this video the other day, Most folk aren't familiar with Immortal Technique because he hasn't received any notable main stream recognition. For those who are familiar with him, he's probably one of the top underground MC's still around, who actually makes an effort to bring social issues to the forefront and focal point of his music.

Either way, check out this freestyle from earlier where he gives a special shout out to the Singhs and 84 its all pretty graphic so the normal disclaimer applies to those with sensitive ears.

  It's not his greatest track by any means, but you got love the shout out he gives..
