Fights only going to last a few hours online before it gets removed, so enjoy it while it lasts. 

For a complete and in depth and real analysis check out, [**<font color="#800000" size="5">Bhagauti Soora's</font>**](http://bhagauti.blogspot.com/2006/11/st-pierres-kingdom.html) post. Personally I have to say this was a refreshing fight to watch and lived up to all the hype that surrounded it. Unlike the Shamrock series which left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth this fight delivered. I remember when these guys first went at it 2 years ago, but I never really took George St Pierre seriously that time around. Kamal quickly showed me the error in my ways none the less, and after watching Pierre against Penn and then Hughes against Penn, I saw that Pierre was definitely the future. 

His whole fighting style is just impeccable. He got's the stand up, the grappling, he is the total package. I think the low blows in this fight were some what over rated, first one didn't really seem to make contact second one, seemed like Hughes was doing a Carter impersonation, but McCarthy was saying it was his ankle that was making contact which I guess I just can't see that clearly from the given angle. 

Anyway's watch and enjoy the fight for yourselves, end of the day, The Champ is here..

By the way Sylvia did good also, every fight he seems to be coming across as being more and more versatile then&nbsp;I imagine, although I still&nbsp; want to see him and Arlovski go at it one more time, just to remove all doubt.
