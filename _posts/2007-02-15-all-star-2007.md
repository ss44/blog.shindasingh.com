Its hard to believe it's already that time of year, it seems like [just yesterday](http://www.shindasingh.com//?p=83 "just yesterday") when I was [protesting Nate Robinson](http://www.shindasingh.com//?p=84 "protesting Nate Robinson") winning the dunk competition. None the less tomorrow marks the start of All Star weekend, so I thought maybe I would set my predictions now, giving those of you interested enough to post your own sometime to chime in.

**Rookie Challenge**: I got the Rookies. I'mma put my faith in this years batch or rook's. The sophomores have been ruling things for the last 5 years now, and I'm sure Vegas is behind the sophomores, but I'm counting on Bargnani, Gay, and Garbo to hold it down and deliver the win.

**Dunk Competition:** If only the judges were the ones doing the dunking then maybe I'd be excited about this years competition, but they're no so we're left to pick from the scraps we got. Nate Robinson is easily the greatest dunker in this years competition, but if he has to take 30 attempts to accomplish a single dunk then by no means does he deserve to win. Howard is a ferocious dunker, but he just doesn't get high enough to perform the air time acrobatics that make a great dunk. Thomas I just don't see him having the creativity to wow the masses. Leaving Green as the only real hope, and personally out of spite for Nate I'm going to go with him to take it this year. This kid enjoys dunking, and he does it well, and if we are to believe all those inspirational quotes that we hear growing up, then my money's on this kid to take it, in other words, Green is my pick for Dunk King 2007.

**Skills Competition:** I'm divided on who to pick, Lebron or Wade. It's not that I don't think Kobe can win, I just don't think Kobe wants to win. Come all star weekend he's all about seeming like one of the guys and I think he does what he can to come across as being a nice and humble guy who isn't possessed by the demon that pushes him to be the greatest basketball player in the history of the game. As for Lebron, he is the King for a reason, but Wade is Wade, and that laid back swagger he carries himself with may just lead him to reigning supreme once again. As far as Paul, he could possibly pull it off also, but seeing as how I'm not all that familiar with his game nor have I really watched him, I just dont feel comfortable enough putting any hope into him, although everyone's [favourite candidate](http://www.votemandeep.com/ "favourite candidate") thinks otherwise.

**Shooting Stars:** Does anyone really care about this? Get rid of this and get more people in the dunk comp.

**3 Point Shoot-out:** Due to the dunk comp's downfall the 3 point shootout is usually the main thing I look forward to watching all star weekend and this year my money is on Jason Terry. This is the year Nortwitzki retires his crown and passes the the thrown to his boy. Gilbert scored 9 points in a game that he called out and said he's scoring 50; the equivalent of [The Babe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth "The Babe") pointing to the heavens but getting struck out. Damon Jones, yea he's a non factor.

**The Race:** Bavetta. Charles it fat, and out of shape, too bad the [local sarpanch disagrees](http://pindgagan.wordpress.com/2007/01/28/its-on-like-donkey-kong/ "local sarpanch disagrees").

So there you have it. Now go wild and cut up my predictions or post your own or even check how my picks compare against [Sarpanch Gagan's](http://pindgagan.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/nba-all-star-2007/ "Sarpanch Gagan") whatever makes you happy.
