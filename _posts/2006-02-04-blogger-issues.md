Apparently Blogger is having issues, and my blogs been acting up worse then a French poodle with diheriea. So if you posted a comment and it was up and now its not, or vice versa, or vice versa of that, then dont worry, it hasn't been deleted. Its just problems with their (blogger.com's) system. Hopefully things will be back to normal by tommarow. So I guess no new posts until then.
