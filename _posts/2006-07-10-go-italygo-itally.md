Well the World Cup wrapped up yesterday, to many peoples relief, and I could say I'm neither happy or disappointed. It was good while it lasted. Gave me something to talk about with people who I would have normally had nothing to talk about with. It also made for interesting radio, with the Fan 590's Bobcat blasting soccer fans the world over for being the dumbest of human species on a daily basis.

Personally I made an effort to watch this year, and I was able to catch 2, 3 games, and to be honest they weren't all that bad. Having had played soccer for the better part of the last school year, gave me a new appreciation for the sport, so being able to watch any random game that was on at a given time and not get bored like I was in the past was definitely a good thing.

Anyways the one thing about the World Cup espeically here in Toronto is that it gives a good number of people a reason to celebrate something. Now anyone who knows Toronto, knows that its got a huge Italian community, larger then all the desi's communities, and on top of that the Italians are definitely a rowdy bunch.

Having heard so much about the rukas caused after an Italy win, a bunch of us decided to hit up Woodbridge and check out the celebrations. At first the plan was to just observe, but that quickly changed to actually take part, as we were able to put together a make shift Italian flag out of old dastaars and chuni's. What followed was us driving down Highway 7, with some going as far as dressing up in tight Adidas tracks and acting like die hard Azuri fans.

The people (Italians), you could tell were shocked and surprised to say the least. Everyone was trying to cop a photo while many others just applauded and cheered and were happy to see us take part while others shook there heads in disgust as we blatantly hijacked what they felt was _there_ time to shine. Anyways event went good and Gursheel's camera really went to work.

Below are some images from the day, and I'm sure Gursheel we'll be adding the many others worth sharing onto [his blog](http://gursheelsingh101.wordpress.com/), or even [flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gursheelsingh/) so check those out also.

Anyways holla atcha boy..
