Having just read [Simmon](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060620)'s article on game 5, I'm left to wonder if Kobe Bryant will ever equal or become as good as either Leborn or Wade?

Many of you are probably shaking your head and like Cuban thinking, what a f'd up question, considering Kobe is older then the two, and accomplished more then either of the two combined. But if one was to do a projection graph for either of these 2 super stars, then its safe to say that the extrapolated data, would show these 2 far above Bryant and in a league closer to Jordan then anyone before them..

So being to lazy to go into this any further I'll let you all decide...
