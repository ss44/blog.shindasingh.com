As the next generation of Punjabi kids begins to come into their own, we are obviously going to see some Punjabi athletes that will go on to have very nice careers at either the University level or maybe even some at the pro level. In basketball, the Westcoast for the longest time has been home to some of the best Punjabi Ballers to date but now our side of the country is starting to produce some legit ballers as well.

It's on that note that I bring to you the #1 ranked Forward in all of Canada.

6'6 Forward out of Brampton - High School Sr. - and a future star at Cornell University - Manvinder "Manny" Sahota.







Holla at ya boy.
