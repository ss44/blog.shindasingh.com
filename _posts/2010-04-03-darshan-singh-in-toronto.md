The following is a [note that was posted on facebook](http://www.facebook.com/notes/jvala-singh/darshan-singh-in-toronto/415364380791) by a friend regarding the Darshan Singh protests that happened yesterday in Toronto. While I wasn't at the event I did feel that panthic.org's coverage was more then just a little skewed, and that this note resonated well with my own views on what happened.

* * *Before people read this, everyone knows I am for Guru Gobind Singh Ji's bani, but what happened in Toronto yesterday must be explained from an objective viewpoint and not the biased and extreme panthic.org viewpoint.</p> 

Some facts of what happened April 2, 2010 at Sikh Lehar Centre in Toronto, \*based on eyewitness accounts, I was not there, but 3-4 people I have talked to were\*

  * Pro-Dasam-Granth Singhs were heard making "battle-tactics", how to get into Sikh Lehar Centre, and remarking they will chop Darshan Singh and his supporters into peices
  * Pro-Dasam-Granth Singhs were heard saying, "if you are not ready to give your head today, then leave" making it seem like it was a battle to the death.
  * Pro-Dasam-Granth Singhs went into a "formation" to try to enter the Sikh Lehar Centre and were stopped at the door. After being refused to get in, weapons were drawn and Sikh Lehar Centre members were attacked with swords and sticks.
  * Sikh Lehar Centre members were hit with swords and sticks.

This shows that clearly Singhs went there with an intention to inflict bodily harm towards members of Sikh Lehar Centre. Panthic.org's report and JS's report that Singhs attacked in self-defense is total bullshit. JS, by the way, showed up after the altercation occurred, so him posting a picture (which he took after everything happened) and inferring that he was there while it happened is bullshit.

Many Singhs, who are Pro-Dasam Granth, left after seeing the extremism and total disregard for humanity.

**So this brings us to the point, should we be actively trying to kill/harm people who do not support Dasam Granth? Do not get me wrong, protesting peacefully is one thing, but going directly and trying to bust into a gurdrawa and 'chop into peices' Anti-Dasam Granth supporters is another.** 

I do not support this view and anyone who does should seriously re-think their beliefs. A very big percent of the Panth right now does not even believe in Raagmala from Adi Guru Granth Sahib, are you going to massacre all of them? What about the part of the Panth that does not believe in Sarbloh Granth, which btw is a pretty common belief even amongst the traditional Sikh groups like the Nirmala Sampradya.

Education is the only solution to the Anti-Dasam Granth problem. Fighting only polarizes the situation, because it creates and places more faith in the minds of the Anti-Dasam Granth supporters.

The Problem we have is that we ourselves, the Pro-Dasam Granth supporters are not even educated, and are not getting out there to the public and doing as much prachaar as the anti-dasam granth lot.
