[Check out Scoop Jackson's take on the Antonio Davis incident.](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jackson/060119)

Kicking Davis out of the game was good enough, suspending him is a bit harsh and is only the result of last years brawl at the palace.

The way 9-11 made everyone in the states paranoid about anyone of Eastern decent or values, the brawl at the palace last year had a similar effect about players entering the stands.
