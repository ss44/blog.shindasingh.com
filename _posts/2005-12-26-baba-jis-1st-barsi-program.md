</div>Saturday, December 24th, marked Sant Baba Takhur Singh Ji's 1st Barsi. It was a year ago, that Baba Ji, left this mortal plane and went on to merge with Nirankaar. Programs were held by the various Sangats around the world.The program we did in Toronto went smoothly and the Keertan was good, but the overall program wasn't mind blowing like other programs I've been to in the past, or maybe I've just come to have high expectations? Actually in reflection the keertan was pretty amazing, the youth that did Keertan did an amazing job and the Raagi's that showed, well they ripped it still, but for some reason or another my mind was busy in its own world that I really wasn't able to enjoy the Kirtan like I should have.One of the actual highlights for me of the night came when Singh Sahib (Jaswant Singh) (Ex. Granthi of Damdama Sahib?, and Malton Gurdwara) did Katha. Singh Sahib, themselves stayed and grew up doing sevaa for Sant Baba Gurbachan Singh and as such grew up with Baba Ji, so the stories they shared were first person experiences they had with Baba Ji, growing up.[<img width="258" height="169" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/image_01_big-793517.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/image_01_big-796636.jpg)When Baba Ji came to be with Sant Baba Gurbachan Singh, Mahpursh asked Baba Ji if they had come after leaving attachment of their home behind or if they would just be visiting with the Jatha for a while. Baba Ji replied to Mahpursh that they were planning on staying with the Jatha for the rest of their lives and if Mahpursh did kirpaa serve the Singhs and Sangat for as long as they could. Baba Ji then began their life in Taksal, under the guidance of Sant Baba Gurbachan Singh, and would do as much as possible to serve the Singhs. While doing sevaa of mahpursh along side other Singhs such as Shaheed Gurmukh Singh Aurdeesa, Baba Ji made it habit to wake up early at AmritVelaa (around 2 AM) , do their Nitnem of Panj Granthi, and would then go and start preparing Langar for the Singhs, and did so everyday without fail.One time Singh Sahib and another Singh wondered how Baba Ji was able to wake up so early, without fail and figured to find out they would wake up earlier and see what Baba Ji's secret was. (This is before the time of digital alarm clocks, and cell phones with alarm features) . So that night Singh Sahib and the other Singh (I think the Singh was Jasbir Singh Rode's father, but can't remember for sure), anyways the two of them went to sleep extra early that night, and woke up a bit after 12. Seeing the time they figured they had enough time and so they went to Darbaar Sahib (The Jathaa was in Amritsar at the time), to do ishnaan and keep Amrit Velaa, and when they where in the parkarmaa they saw Baba Ji, and again were baffled and wondered how Baba Ji woke up so early. Throughout their life, Baba Ji continued to serve the Sangat and the Singhs, without fail, and even in old age did as much sevaa as they could for the Singhs.So[<img width="201" height="122" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/03-768145.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/03-774015.jpg) great was the respect for Baba Ji in the jathaa, that when Sant Kartaar Singh became mukhi of Taksal they told the Singhs that they could choose listen to what they had to say, if they agreed or not with them it was all good, but no Singh was to go against anything Baba Takhur Singh Ji said or requested, and no bachan/hukam of there's was to be returned or questioned by the Singhs.This love and admiration for Baba Ji, was so felt by Sant Jarnail Singh, that Sant Jarnail Singh would tell the Singhs that if at any time, anything happened to them or if they ever went missing (The morchaa was starting up), that whatever Baba Ji said was to be adhered to and listned to, and no Singh was to go against or challenge Baba Ji.One time a family from UK or Canada was visiting with Sant Jarnail Singh and they had come to see Sant Ji after hearing about how great and godly of a person Sant Jarnail Singh was. At the [<img width="209" height="119" border="0" align="left" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Jernail_3-779980.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Jernail_3-782463.jpg)time Baba Ji and the Singhs had just returned from a trip and Sant Jarnail Singh noticed Baba Ji from the corner of his eye. Second Sant Ji noticed Baba Ji, they hurriedly excused themselves from the company of the family meeting with him and went to Baba Ji and made a quick effort to touch Baba Ji's feet and said Fateh, asking Baba Ji how things went etc. The family who came were some what dumb founded, as to what was going on and to what they where seeing, as they figured that Sant Jarnail Singh was the big man on campus so who was this old man that Sant Ji was showing so much respect and love for. When Sant Jarnail Singh returned the family asked Sant Ji who the Singh was that they went to meet, and Sant Ji told them if they wanted Darshan of Vaheguroo in human form then they had to look no further then to look at Baba Ji.Its because of this respect and love for Baba Ji shown by Sant Jarnail Singh that Singhs continue to follow Sant Jarnail Singhs bachan and follow Baba ji's bachan in that Sant Jarnail Singh are in Chardi Kalaa.I remember when I first met Baba Ji, it was when they where here in Toronto in 2000. At that time I had just taken amrit maybe a month or two earlier, and so I really had no clue who Baba Ji was. I knew about Operation blue star, and I knew about Sant Jarnail Singh to some degree, (but then again when you went to Malton Gurdwara, how could you not).I had 3rd period lunch, and so I was chilling with Gurjeet and he told me he had to go home 4th period since Baba Ji was going to be coming over with Singhs for Langar, and insisted I go home with him, skipping 4th period, to meet Baba Ji. Not really wanting to go to class to begin with, I figured this was as good a reason as any to skip, so we kicked it to Gurjeets house.Baba Ji and the Singhs rolled in about 10 minutes after we showed up. Back then Baba Ji rolled with a Jatha of about 20, 30 Singhs, so when the first batch of Singhs arrived, things started to get real busy. Some of the Singhs sat down for langar while others helped in serving them, and a steady flow of 6, 7, Singhs was streaming in and out, as they arrived, so we did Sevaa as it came. Mean while I was wondering when I'd see Baba Ji, really not knowing anything about them, but just curious to see who they where, considering it was Gurjeets main selling point in coming over in the first place.After the last batch of Singhs were leaving, the Singhs who were doing Sevaa, sat down and we also then ate. I really didn't know who Baba Ji was still since there were a few Singhs who could have just as easily fit the bill of being Baba-ish. It wasn't until after when I saw pictures that I knew who Baba Ji was. Now some may just find it ignorant that I wasn't able to spot Baba Ji out like that, but I would never have thought Baba Ji was the same Singh who I was serving langar along side with the entire time, even after when I sat down Baba Ji was part of the sevadaars who were serving me langar.Up 'till then, the way I had pictured a Sant was someone who, well stood out. Apart from the cliche's of a heavenly aura I was expecting someone who everyone was just catering to in every single possible way. Instead it turned out that Baba Ji was more for serving the Sangat then being served by the Sangat, a philosophy and trait that is rare amongst modern day "Sants".This became one of the key features of Baba ji's character. At that time (2000) Baba Ji was in[<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/11-746075.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/11-751010.jpg) good health and so they where moving around pretty freely. The few times I met Baba Ji after that, there health had deteriorated considerably, but even in the years post, I have memories of Baba Ji serving the Sangat for as long as they could stand on there own, even if it was something just as simple as handing out parshaday.Now I know I've written more then you want to read already, but as I'm going through this more stories keep popping to mind. Like the time a few of us went to meet Baba Ji in New York (the first trip, I think it was the summer of 2003). Skipping details about the trip we end up arriving at around 1 or 2 in the morning. We walk in and are greeted by the 2 Singhs who are awake, and we figure that Baba Ji was asleep and that we could just duck out and find places to sleep for the night. (It had been a long day and an even longer drive, and we where all jonzed to just sleep). Baba Ji was just waking up as we arrived and noticed us tip towing around, and told the Singhs who were awake and reading Bani to go and first get us something to eat, as we had come from far, and then find us a place to sleep. Even when we where leaving to come back home, Baba Ji made sure we where taken care of.Chullo I'mma stop this here, just because the Sakhis keep flowing to mind, and I'm sure I've annoyed most of you by now the the countless spelling and grammar mistakes.
