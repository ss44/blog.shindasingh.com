It's time to make a return of something I used to do a few years ago or maybe even last year. I can't remember. Then again, I can hardly remember what happened yesterday let alone two years ago.

The NFL season is back in full swing so let me drop down my picks for week 2 ATS (Against the spread). All lines are taken from <a href="http://proline.olg.ca/pointspreadEvents.do" target="_blank">Pro-Line</a>.

Buffalo @ **Green Bay** -14.5.
