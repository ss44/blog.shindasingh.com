So yesterday, was the protest at the banquet hall where the seminar was supposed to have been held. However having received the Sandesh from Sri Akaal Takhat the night before, the owner quickly canceled the program. So as Scott Hall would say, "_Looks like another one for the good guys."_

Due to the cancellation of the program all busses were also canceled,&nbsp;none the less a group of about 200 Singhs still gathered at the hall to protest. Ghagga's crew also showed with roughly 20, 30 supporters, who either didn't hear about the cancellation or wanted to try and spur a confrontation, none the less the visible police presence kept things from getting rowdy, and with Ghagga himself being a no show tempers were kept under control. 

Expectedly, Ghagga and supporters later that night (Sahota on Sur Sagar), took pot shots at the Sandesh given by Akaal Takhat Sahib, and lobbied there disgust with the protest, clearly showing there frustration with this month long ordeal. 

I think what hurt them more then the Sandesh was the quick diss-association by the Missionary colleges that Ghagga himself claimed to be representative of.

Having been run out of Europe, UK, and even parts of the States, Toronto Sangat&nbsp;comprised of various Sangat from&nbsp; the various jathebandhi's, gurdwara committee's, councils and organizations all seemingly worked well together in tackling this foe, reminiscent of the saying: "_My Brother and I against My Cousin; My Cousin and I against the Stranger."_
