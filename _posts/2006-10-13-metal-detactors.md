If you wear a Kirpaan then you've probably been involved in a scenario similar to the above. It's because of&nbsp;such scenarios that&nbsp;I hate metal detactors, since&nbsp;its their insinuous beeping that brings about the interrogation that is sure to follow.&nbsp;None the less in a world warped in paranoia over security threats, of which metal detactors act as&nbsp;the first line of defense, its safe&nbsp;to assume that they wont be going anywhere anytime soon. So seeing as how I can't beat them, and seeing how I normally don't much enjoy the scenarios that result, I tend to avoid places which have metal detactors installed. Airports, court houses, Sports stadiums in America. If there are high chances of ignorance&nbsp;+ metal&nbsp;detector then chances are I'll be avoiding that place. 

So you can imagine my dismay when I read, 

> In reaction to this note&nbsp;note, security of Sri Harmandir Sahib was greatly&nbsp;heightened to eliminate any chances of letting this&nbsp;'threat' come true.&nbsp; Capt. Amarinder Singhâ€™s Government took the initiative of providing the complex with additional security guards outside. **In addition, metal detectors were also installed&nbsp;at the main gates to check all visiting pilgrims.**He&nbsp;added that if the SGPC President so&nbsp;permitted, covert security guards would be assigned to monitor the inside.&nbsp;   
> [- Panthic Weekly](http://www.panthic.org/news/125/ARTICLE/2807/2006-10-11.html)

Go figure, that at the holiest shrine of the Sikhs,&nbsp;the last place you'd conceive to have thought you'd be harassed over being a Sikh, Amritdhari's are now being made to check&nbsp;there Kirpans in&nbsp;at the door. 

Fine I'm exaggerating, but none the less, how is installing a metal detectors at Darbaar Sahib going to stop someone from walking in with explosives? Why not have bomb sniffing dogs waiting outside at the gates?&nbsp;and even more since when did Sikhs, need Government protection. What we really need is a restraining order against the&nbsp;Government, since they're the ones always shooting us in the back, and when&nbsp;confronted&nbsp;about it they just shrug there shoulders and say, "wasn't me", but then again that's neither here nor there.

Anyway's, it feels good to have gotten that of my chest, now to get back to&nbsp;reading and coding...have a nice day...
