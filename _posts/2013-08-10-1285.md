<p style="text-align: left;">
  A silent revolution is now occurring around us.
</p>

One in which we, more specifically our data is the victim. As convenient as the cloud is, never forget that it comes with a risk, and to be responsible when it comes to who we in-trust our data with, and more specifically with what.

While most of us will never feel the need to protect our data, the fact that we no longer control who has what access to our own information, means we're moving towards a society where only the privy'd can have and keep secrets.

Amidst such a revolution we should solute those who take a stand with us, and more importantly make note and be weary of those who choose not to.
