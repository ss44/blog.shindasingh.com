I'm going to be honest (when haven't I been), and lay it straight. I've never watched a full game of soccer or as the rest of the world likes to call it Football. I've played it, not to well mind you, but seeing as to how Mandeep went to the lengths of calling me and saying in his raspy loud voice, "yo guy write a post on it", I feel nothing less then obliged to create this topic.

For those of you as ignorant as me to way it works (correct me if I'm wrong) you got several pools with 6 teams each. For the first while, each team plays within its pool, and from there the top two teams qualify for the actual tourney.

For more info on the teams and all that jazz check out the [official site.](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bracket.html)

With that said here are my picks as to who's going to win what pool:

Group A: 1st: Germany 2nd: Costa Rica
  
Group B: 1st: England 2nd: Sweden
  
Group C: 1st: Argentina 2nd: Serbia and Montenegro
  
Group D: 1st: Portugal 2nd: Mexico
  
Group E: 1st: Italy 2nd: USA
  
Group F: 1st: Brazil 2nd: Croatia
  
Group G: 1st: France 2nd: Korea
  
Group H: 1st: Spain 2nd: Saudi Arabia

Now I'll leave 'yall to go at it...
