  <em>When the rich wage war its the poor who die, when the Akali's wage war its the blood of the Panth that's spilled.</em>

<a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/LoosePughTheBadalConspiracy_B43C/theboss%5B2%5D8.gif" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px" height="220" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/LoosePughTheBadalConspiracy_B43C/theboss_thumb9.gif" width="240" align="right" /></a>For years now we've heard accusations of Badal being the puppet master, using the SGPC and the Akal Takhat to do his dirty work, but in recent weeks with the situation in Punjab, Badal's grip on Punjab, the Panth and his true motives have never been clearer.

See as much as we want to believe that the recent weeks have shown the Panths ability to come together and group against a&nbsp;common foe, that the Singh's in Punjab are tired of taking things lightly and are ready once again to rise up, the truth is far from it. Rather what the events of the recent weeks have shown is that Badal has the power to manipulate the Panth into serving as his own personal army. 

Lets face facts although what the Dera chief did was wrong, it's not the worst that's happened . See as bad as doing beadbi and attempting to make a mockery of the amrit sinchar is, he's not the first to do it. Mann Chand, the Naamdharis all beat him to that punch and have been doing it for a while now. 

If it's the fact that he's a pakhandi sant with the guise of a Sikh, with multiple CBI cases against him ranging from murder, rape etc then again he's not the first, there have been worse,&nbsp;Nang Phula, Mann Chand and countless other so&nbsp;called Babay who have raped innocent girls only doors away from Maharaaj ta Darbaar roam free in Punjab with seemingly full immunity, some even with Badals blessing and support.

If it's the fact that his followers have hurt peaceful&nbsp;Sikh protestors leading to one Singhs shaheedi, then why is it that the likes of KPS Gill, Amita Bachan, Ashotoush and Noormalia, haven't been asked to surrender, after all shirly they have spilled more sikh blood then this clown.

Why is it that a small band of "bhajangi Khalsa" a force that has been reported to be no greater then a few hundred young Sikhs, been placed in charge to deal with the Dera's if they refuse to abide by the ultimatum set fourth by the Akal Takhat, knowing full well that the Dera and its followers won't go without a fight. If this were to happen and a confrontation to ensue then the the Singhs involved would no doubt be outnumbered and&nbsp;made to give up their lives attaining&nbsp;Shaheedi, which could&nbsp;easily be avoided simply by increasing the #'s of these fauj's. After all why sacrifice a drop of blood if it isn't needed?

<a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/LoosePughTheBadalConspiracy_B43C/antigurmata%5B4%5D8.gif" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px" height="160" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/LoosePughTheBadalConspiracy_B43C/antigurmata_thumb%5B2%5D8.gif" width="186" align="right" /></a> Now lets not also forget that Malwa the center in which the Dera has the most clout, reportedly voted 60% in favour of Congress as opposed to apparently having had a long history of being an Akali hot seat. Knowing that Badal has used strong armed tactics in various forms in the past to intimidate the electorate could this attack not be seen as nothing more then Badal merely flexing some muscle?&nbsp;It will be interesting to see how such of an effect on the polls closing of the&nbsp;Dera's&nbsp;and everything else that has gone on,&nbsp;has next time around. 

Lets not also dismiss the mixed signals coming out of the various parties. For instance the Hukamnaama for a full out closure which after realizing lack of jurisdiction to this regard has been re-evaluated to being a&nbsp;favourably worded apology.&nbsp;

&nbsp;The natural question that comes to mind after all of the above is why? What do the Badal's and Akali's have to gain from such actions. Well being able to coerce the Akal Takhat into making concessions does Badal not come out looking like the good guy the one who brought an end to the protests, exuberating the leadership expected of him? The cool head in a tense situation makes him look gold. Would sacrificing many more of our youth if need be not serve to rile up the Panth into a full out war against the Dera? Most likely the case, which again goes to server the Akalis more then anyone else. Why is it that the Dera is the target of all this as opposed to other individuals who&nbsp;have done the Panth more harm in the past 20 years? Is it because the others cooperate with Badal and are on his good side? Could it not be, because the Dera can be touched and the wrath of a few thousand poor is less feared then that of the political might that could be possibly felt if one went up against the likes of KPS Gill or Ashotoush? What about the fact that such actions serve to only strengthen the Akali party which Badals son is being groomed to take lead of in the near future. Giving him the party, after presenting the need for an Akali goverment in punjab, only serves to impower and ensure that the Badal legacy and tenure of terror continues.

I fully understand and realize&nbsp;that we could play the game of _"what if"_ all day, and speculation is nothing more then hearsay with legs, but given the past history of the Badal's and SAD, it would be ignorant and deviant-ly deceitful on our own parts to at least not look at the situation from as many different angles as possible, after all, _"If you can't see the angles no more, you're in trouble."_
