So I went the otherday to look for new phones, and so I hit up Billings Bridge, the Ottawa equivalent of Shoppers World (Brampton), and go to the Wireless Wave they had figuring that they'd have all the Fido phones there.

So I go in, and start looking through the fido thing they got setup and the sales cleark (John) doesn't waste any time in letting me browse and asks if I can use any help, and I was like oh no da doubt my dwami... and told him my situation and what I was looking for. Dude was like naw, your plan wont work, unless I cancel my current number and get a new account, meaning new number.

Then he was like well if thats what you plan on doing, then you should try Bell, same price, same plan, better service, couldn't really argue with that, so then he popped out the phones, which he thought where in my price range.

First he pulled out this phone by LG. I was pretty impressed by the whole thing. The phone was[<img width="82" height="130" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/62559-716170.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/62559-718024.jpg) the LG 325, and it reminded me a lot of the Matrix phone where the key pad dropped down. Really they key pad just slides down to give you more screen. Its cool all the same. I wasn't shocked by it, but the deal he was working out for me was going to get me that phone for free on a 3 year, term. Also phone had blue tooth which I figured may have some use if not now, then later on down the road. I was pretty much set on grabbing this phone but then I decided to check to see if theres any flip phones available just because the Siemens I had was a similar design and I figured its time to change to flip, after all they look do look coooler.

So I asked him for flip phones in the same leauge and so he goes yea check this one out, and pulls[<img width="91" height="119" border="0" align="left" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/63015-779023.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/63015-783141.jpg) out the Motorola E815. After some questions I decide to go with the Motorola, because it can play MP3's and has an expansion slot, and well it just seemed like the overal better phone and with the same going rate, I figured can't go wrong. So this my friends is my new phone. I know its nothing fancy dancy like Jasdevs old phone, but chhh, what you going to do, I aint no jatehdar yet.

So that my friends is my new phone. The screens huge. The features seem endless, and the navigation and all that well compared to the Siemens is well 100x better. But then again so's the phones price and model number. So that is that. I got a new number also, so if your one of those people who I do give my number out to be sure to ask. Otherwise good luck in trying to get it.

Hun Akhooooooooo Saaaaaaaaaaaaaat naaam Sreee Vahegurooo Jeee..
