Anything that goes big, or finds success is bound to be copied, but the duplicates never really match up with the originals. So is the case with The Papdits. CBS's version of Borat, where they replaced the Khazikstani reporter with a lost and bewildered family from India, trying to make it in the States. Although its as funny as hearing a joke that you like slaughtered by someone who just can't tell it, it does pass a good 15 minutes of time when studying for those exams.

        Now that you feel less inspired and frustrated, get back to work.
