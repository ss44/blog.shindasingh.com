These days its not uncommon to here about Sikhs, (actual amritdhari's), being spotted at clubs and jams. Every now and then I have friends who tell me about spotting Amrtidhari gursikhs at clubs or jams that they recently went to, and often they are confused by this, since on one hand we preach that clubbing and jams are against Gurmat, and should be avoided, on the other hand Gursikhs who you would expect to know better are booked at these places.

Once during a job interview a few years back, my boss was commenting about something on my resume, (I had listed a drug and abuse seminar that we held at Malton Gurdwara in 2002), and was asking me questions about it. I told him that the Punjabi community was suffering from a silent plague of spousal and druge abuse, and this was just an effort to show people where they could get help from.

Since I was applying for a job at a security agency, the interviewer shared his own stories of spousal abuse that he had witnessed while on the job. His story was basically about guys who went to strip clubs got rowdy with the stippers and after being removed would go home and abuse and assault their wives. I told him that these people arn't Sikh rather Punjabi, but he was like nah, these guys kept long beards and tied turbans like mine. After hearing that I was somewhat dumbfounded and at a loss of words, since it was common to hear things about punjabis (monay, etc) but not about keshdharis. At that time I just shut up, feeling embarrased and let things go on with the interview.

Its here where I think its only approriate to share the sakhi of Bhai Joga Singh, a Sikh who lived during the time of Guru Gobind Singh Ji.

> BHAI JOGA SINGH:
> 
> From the early youth Joga Singh was living at the Guru's Darbar and was a great devotee. One day Guru's eye caught him and he asked what his name was. He replied," O true king, my name is Joga Singh." The Guru asked," Whose Joga you are?" (Joga means for whose service he is fit or simply for whom he is?) "I am Guru Joga (I am in the service of the Guru)," replied Joga Singh. Upon this the Guru promised," If you are Guru Joga, then Guru is tere Joga ( then the Guru is for you)."
> 
> After sometimes Joga Singh went to his home in Peshawar for his marriage. When the marriage ceremony was half-way through, a man arrived with an urgent message from the Guru to him to proceed to Anandpur without delay. Joga Singh read the command and instantly left for Anandpur without completing the marriage ceremony. He obeyed Guru's order over everything else. Indeed the path of the devotees is sharper than the edge of a razor blade, and it is even narrower than the hair-breadth on which they have to tread.
> 
> Joga Singh continued his journey to Anandpur as fast as he could. After passing through Lahore and Amritsar, he reached a resting spot at Hoshiarpur. On his way his ego got inflated and he thought," Who could have acted like me? Certainly very few Sikhs would carry out the Guru's order like me." This sense of pride brought his fall. At night he was overwhelmed by evil-passion and he started towards the house of a prostitute. Joga Singh was wearing Guru's uniform- a turban and beard. On his way to the prostitute, Joga Singh talked to himself," If some one sees me going into the house of a prostitute, it will bring disgrace to the Guru. Outwardly I am in Guru's attire. So nobody should see me entering the prostitute's house."
> 
> As soon as he reached near the house of the prostitute, a watchman appeared saying aloud," Be aware fellows!" Joga Singh could not enter the house and he walked on to the next street. Looking around and thinking that the watchman might have left, he hurried towards the house of the prostitute again. To his amazement the watchman reappeared shouting," Be aware fellows!" Joga Singh could not afford to be seen by anybody going into the house of the prostitute, knowing in his heart that it would bring slur to Guru's name since he was in Guru's uniform. Finally he quit his evil act after trying a few times without success.
> 
> Next morning he started his journey and reached Anandpur. Joga Singh stood mute before the Guru with his head down. The Guru asked him about the well-being of himself and his family but Joga Singh stood mute. The divine Master then addressed him," Joga Singh, do you remember when you said that you were Guru Joga, and the Guru had promised, if you were Guru Joga, then Guru tere Joga." Upon this the Guru further explained,"In the garb of a watchman I guarded you in the streets of Hoshiarpur last night, against the sinful deeds and thus saved you from disgrace." Joga Singh fell on Guru's feet and asked for forgiveness.
> 
> Such are the ways of the Master. Once we put our complete faith in him, he does not abandon us. The Guru confirms:
> 
> "As long as the Khalsa remain distinct and intact, I shall bless them in every way; When they detract from the prescribed path, I detest them for ever."
