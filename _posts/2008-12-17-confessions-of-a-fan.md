I have a confession to make.

It's been inside of me buried somewhere so deep that I didn't even know it existed. And when these feelings came out, I was shocked, I was disappointed, I was sad.

Coming from the parts that I roll from, this may be considered treason. However, I have to let it out.

Let me break it down for you.

I was browsing YouTube and came across a Vince Carter (I have formerly referred to him as Wince Carter and the half man that should not be named) interview after the Nov. 21-2008 game in which he ripped out our hearts and stomped on them again.



And then I found this following video:



And to be honest, after watching those two videos, I got sad. I got really sad. Call me what you want but that's a lot to comprehend in a small amount of time. Especially after Vince says things like:

"It's like home."

"They boo you because they miss you."

"I grew up here."

Why, why would you say something like that Vince? Why? I want to continue to hate him, I really do and for the longest time I have hated him and I still might hate him. But when he says things like that, it just breaks my heart all over again.

This is like a bitter divorce in where the wife (Carter) cheats on her husband (Raps Fans) and leaves and she gets over it quickly but the poor guy wants to be over it, he really does but he just can't forget what happened. He keeps saying it's time to move on but really can't because everytime she comes back, the feelings come pouring out again. And in the back of his head he thinks about everything all over again. Would it be really that bad if we got back together? Would it?

And from that it led me ESPN Trade Machine to make a trade to bring back the man that onces was called Air Canada to Canada.

Vince Carter for Anthony Paker, Kris Humphries or Bargnani and Moon or Graham plus a future pick.

The trade works it really does and to be honest, as much as I hate Vince for everything he's done, I'm willing to forgive him if he apologizes. I want him to come out and say he was sorry for mailing it in, I want him to say he's sorry for what he did to us, I want him to apologize for putting us through the Rob Babcock era, I want him to apologize for making us the laughing stock of the NBA and maybe, just maybe, we can forgive and sometime in the future, forget.

Because let's face it, everytime you boo him, you boo him because you miss him and you can't help but think what would've happened if you kept him or how different it would be if he was to come back.

And let's face it, everytime he comes back to Toronto, the man walks with his balls out people, BALLS OUT!
