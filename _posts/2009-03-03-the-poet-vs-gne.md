As of late the qualtiy of Sikh, Punjabi/Desi rappers has risen dramatically, enough to actually pit two similar tracks against one another.

In that vain lets get at it with Humble the Poet's Fuck With Gaza versus GNE's Soulja's Story. 

**GNE - Soulja's Story**



**Humble The Poet - I Fucks with Gaza**



So let it be known who you think takes this round. Having re-visted both I still like The Poet's flow and straight attacks. But based on lyrics I will have to give this one to G.N.E.

Lines that stood out in particular:
