I realize, I've been out of commission for sometime now, and I wasn't able to follow through with a so called comeback as I wanted, but eh, that's just how things rolled out. I figure the biggest drawback was a change in scenery which left me without some of my blogging apps ie (Life Writer), and the thought of having to use wysiswyg editor provided by wordpress well its enough to keep me from posting. 

Anyways hopefully this new app that I'm testing out (KBlogger) works and if so, to many of your dismays(?) will have me back to ranting like the grumpy old man that I'm going to grow into being.

But for now lets just hope this post gets posted...
