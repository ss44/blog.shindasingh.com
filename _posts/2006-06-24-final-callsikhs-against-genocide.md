This is just a reminder, that the Sikhs Against Genocide Save Darfur program is **TOMORROW**. Bring you uncle, aunt, neice, nephew, tya, chachaa, mamaa, puphar, bapoo, mumee, masi, masar, pua and whoever else you can possibly think of.

_Why?_ Becaues Sikhs are Against the Genocide in Darfur.

_Does not showing make you a bad person?_ Yes.

_Does it cost you anything?_ No.

Does it help Sikhi? It shows the world and helps educate other communities about who we are, what we do (sevaa), what we believe in (sarbat da bhalla), and more importantly, is the first miniscule step that the Sikh Sangat of Toronto, Ottawa, Ontario, wherever can take on the path of Truth travelled by all our Guru's, even when it ment being made to sit on a burning plate with sand being poured over there bodies, or sitting in a thorned cage, while watching your beloved Sikhs, giving there lives but never there Sikhi, this my friends is your chance to show that these sacrafices taught us something, that this truth still exists in the Sikhs today, and that YOU be coming out, support the freedom of this truth.

So come one, come all, if you only go to the Gurdwara once a year make this the event you come out to. If you only go to the Gurdwara once a month, then make this day the day you come out. If you go to the Gurdwara everyday, like one should, then hope to see you there, and finaly if you have never been to a Gurdwara, let alone know what a Gurdwara is then show up anyways to:
