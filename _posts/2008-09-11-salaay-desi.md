I was on my way home today when I heard about a kidnapping, some 58 year old man who was held for ransom, but fortunatly police found him today walking around in Brampton. At first the story just went in one ear and out the other, and I never gave it a second thought. That was until off course I heard that the man was from Malton, and it wouldn't have taken Miss Cleo to realize that desi's had to have been involved somehow.

So I look it up and and looks like I may be ready for the prime time getting my own psychic hot line or something. Anyways story follows below:
