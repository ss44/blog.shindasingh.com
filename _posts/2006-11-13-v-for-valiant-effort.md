Congratulations to my boy Mandeep AKA Mugsy Dhaliwal who at the age of 21,&nbsp; 2 years out of high school, &nbsp;going only on his own personal wit, despite all the false allegations of us robbing, threatening, vandalizing and harassing Vicky&nbsp;still pulled out 3000 votes in an election that often goes to those who pull out 2500. 

Although we didn't win this time, it took Vicky two tries, a taxi licence and a house to get where he did. Seeing as how you did it with none of that, other then the support of the people around you, consider yourself off to a good start. 

Now although the tone of the post may sound bitter, its far from it. I never expected Vicky to win, I never expected any of the desi's to truthfully win. The fact that one (he) did, impresses me. I may not agree with his tactics but then again this is politics everything goes, and so it did, and for that I will congratulate him for doing what was needed to win. End of the day that's what counts, the W or in this case the&nbsp;reserved parking spot in City Hall with&nbsp;your&nbsp;our name on it, is what counts after all the ballots are tallied.

But as premature as it may sound, the pressure is now on. Every bill and vote that you pass/make will be scrutinized. Every promise made will be held against you for the next 4 years, and in that time you have the chance to either break or make your place in City Hall. After all as impressive as your (Vicky's) &nbsp;victory maybe, realize that you not only helped school us as to what level we need to compete at, but you raised the bar, which means next time around everyone will step there game up just that much more.

P.S the Results.
