So you wanna be a hacker? code cracker? sittin in your room talking smack typa rapper?

Then try your skills at: <http://www.area-6.net>.

Basically its a bunch of hacking challenges, where you're basically hacking for a password. Once you get it, you can use that password to try the next challange.

I remember back in highschool I came across one of these and I got pretty far, but seems like I've lost much of the creative thinking needed to do most of these, but I manage ;).

Anyways try your hand at it. I got up to challenge number 3 no problem, but ran into a bit of a wall (damn you GOOOGLE!!!).

Anyways if you do try it, let me know how you do. (Why do I always find these things when I got mad work to do??)
