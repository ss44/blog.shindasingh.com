I'm not a big fan of the Mac, but I just can't stand Windows, and&nbsp;as the saying goes the enemy of my enemy is my friend. To that end I found one of those Mac vs PC [windows]&nbsp;ads that hasn't or isn't scheduled to be aired, but thought it was one of the better ones yet.

For those who didn't catch what the ad was about, it was basically about Windows taking 5 years to make a clone of Mac OS. Gagan posted this video a while ago highlighting the differences so for those who didn't get the above clip the following may help clear things up.

Then again they're both second grade when&nbsp;they compare to a Linux distro&nbsp;running Beryl, as is seen below:
