Let me get one thing clear.

If you're running a fast break and you look at a player and then look away to the sidelines while throwing that same player the ball, you have NOT completed a no look pass.

Nowadays it seems the art of the no look pass in the NBA and the college ranks is dead like the WNBA's Houston Comets.

I can't stand announcers who get all riled up over a SIMPLE pass where the passer fully looks at the passee for 20 seconds and then passes him ball and then stares into the crowd like he had no idea where that player came from. Friggin' Idiots. That announcer and the player need to be slapped upside the head for getting happy over something so stupid.

I'm no expert but I have seen my share of basketball games to know what accounts for a no look pass. Let me break it down to you lesser beings.

The passer is looking at a defender or another teammate while throwing the ball to another teammate that was not in his line of sight. Ala Magic Johnson who did this to perfection while running the break and also J Kidd in his hey day.

Nowadays there are only a handful of PGs who can make this pass but they rarely do so. The one that I have seen the most is that boy from the south, Chris Paul. Other than him, Deron Williams and Steve Nash can also do a successful no look pass but rarely do so.

So please, don't ruin a once great play by getting excited by a play that anyone can make. Stop ruining the game.

Side Note: Toronto Raptors lower bowl seating is being infected by Suits. FUCK THE SUITS!

Side Note 2: This is directed towards the WNBA, how do you lose a franchise that won FOUR WNBA Titles. Seriously, HOW?! Just as I had started to gain some respect for this godforsaken league, this happens. ISIAH THOMAS FOR COMMISH.

And don't forget, you have to walk with your BALLS OUT PEOPLE, BALLS OUT!
