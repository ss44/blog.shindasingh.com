If you're a man then you know nothing is as funny and as painful as another man getting hit in the pubic region aka getting hit in the balls. If you're a male and over the age of 18, then you have at least once experienced a low blow in some way. Whether it's a punch, kick or some sort of an object, you know it hurts like nothing else.

And if you haven't, then you need to stop calling yourself a member of the male species and it's time to go join the WNBA.

If it doesn't happen to you, a low blow is by far the simplest form of comedy. And when it does happen to you, you laugh as soon as the pain stops.

The reason I bring this up is because a low blow fucks up your body for a short amount of time and to fully understand what happens, the people at Sports Science decided to do some testing and get an answer.

Note: If you just want a laugh, go straight to the second video, but I reccomend you watch both.

Warning: The following videos may make you cringe.





Now that was some educationally funny shit.

Also, props to Jason for taking one in the name of Science.
