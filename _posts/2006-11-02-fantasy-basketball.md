With the new NBA season having kicked of its that time of year again where we launch the fantasy ball leauges. For those interested the leauge info is the following:

<font size="-1" face="arial">In order to join the league, follow the link above or go to <a target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://basketball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/nba">game front page</a>, click the "Sign Up Now" or "Get Another Team" button and follow the links to "Join a Custom League". When prompted, enter the League ID# and password below.</font>

<font size="-1" face="arial">League ID#: 183006<br /> Password: bungagan</font>

<font size="-1" face="arial">We will send you a confirmation with further details once you have completed the registration process. There's only a max of 16 spots (yea its a lot but it should keep things interesting, since you'll be going for those role players to make things count).</font>

BTW Draft happens this <strike>Friday</strike> <strike>Saturday</strike> Sunday(Nov. <strike>4th</strike> 5th) so if you plan on signing up then do it before then.
