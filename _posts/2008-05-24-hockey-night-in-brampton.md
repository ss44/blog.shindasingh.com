Looks like the CBC's tuning into the fact that there is a huge punjabi population in Canada and is offering up game one of tonights NHL playoffs in Punjabi. Thats right, you can now listen to play by play in Punjabi. Whether you'd really want to or not is something on its own, but I'm sure we'll be hearing a lot of, "Oh Crosby Laigiya", "shot mari tey GOOOAL..."Â  or other such antidotes that many may have become accustomed to hearing after having watched Playoff games with family in the past. All the same it's a good development for the community on the national scene, especially when you consider both broadcasters (Parminder and Harnarayan Singh) are both gursikhs.

Anyways the broadcasts will be on the following channels:

  * Shaw Digital Cable (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) on channel 291
  * Bell ExpressVu subscribers on channels 249 and 724;
  * Rogers Digital Cable customers in Ontario and New Brunswick on channel 460;
  * Star Choice subscribers on channel 238.
