WhatÂ’s been speculated, rumored, and hoped for has been today confirmed. Yes ladies and gentlemen, the Toronto Raptors have signed new GM, now ex-Phoenix Suns GM Bryan Colangelo.

The same man who helped build and rebuild the Suns into the monster team in the West that they are now, will **_hopefully_** be able to do the same for the Raptors.

Does this mean we can sleep easy now, and work at getting over the nightmares inflicted on us by the mishaps caused during the Babcock era? I would hope so. Finally we got a decent GM since Grunwald, (_For those against him, just remember who he helped bring to the team, or was that Isaiah?)_

Anyways, with a decent GM in place, I think the fans of Toronto can take refuge in knowing, that things may just be getting better from here on in. But then again as usual, I may just be getting ahead of myself here. Ah well, that I guess is to be expected.
