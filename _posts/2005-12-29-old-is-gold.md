**Got this from the [wired article](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,69900-1.html?tw=wn_story_page_next1) on Best Technological moments of 2005:</p> 

Ancient telegraph operator beats teen texter in speed contest:</strong> A race in Australia last April saw retired post office telegrapher Gordon Hill, 93, [beat the dickens](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-2-1571664,00.html) out of a 13-year-old girl named Brittany, who was armed with a mobile phone and a pair of flying thumbs. Brittany used SMS shorthand, while Hill sent every character of the 21-word-datagram and still won by 18 seconds. Lest this be mistaken for a fluke, a similar contest staged the next month by comedian Jay Leno produced the same results. Meanwhile, the FCC is considering dropping the five-word-per-minute Morse code requirement for new ham radio operators. Maybe they should be making it mandatory for the rest of us instead.
