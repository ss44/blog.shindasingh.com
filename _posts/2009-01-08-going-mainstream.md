It seems as if more and more drugs from India are making their way into Canada. Couple of years ago "Feem" was discovered by both Canadian & US Authorities as a drug and now "Dodaay" are on their radar as well. Dodaay are actually sold more openly than any other drug I can think of but I believe that's about to come to a stop.
