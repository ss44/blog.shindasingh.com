I got this email a while ago, and thought it was pretty jokes. For those who don't get it, the Centennial foundation has come under fire in recent years for the guests they choose to honour as having contributed to the Sikh cause in some form or another. I remember last year they felt it appropriate to honour [Khushwant Singh](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=50), and this year it's none other then&nbsp;every Sikhs favourite historian or I guess dist-orian, (however you want see him),&nbsp;Dr. W. Hew McLeod. 

To his credit McLeod has spawned his own form of McLeodian Sikhi which has been embraced the world over by dumb-asses of all races and nationalities. It's interesting to see how McLeod's work on Sikhi serves the Sikh cause when some examples of quotes from his writings include such statements as:

> "It is misleading to call Guru Nanak the founder of Sikh religion, as he did not originate a new school of thought or set of teachings……Guru Nanak established a Panth as sect of Hindusim and not a new religion.”

> "The ten Gurus never preached one set of religious doctrines or system……,

> "The arming of the Panth could not have been the result of any decision by Guru Hargobind, but because of Jat influx in the Sikh fold…….

> "The traditional account about the founding of the Khalsa on the Vaisakhi day of the year 1699, (A.D.) cannot be accepted, as there are \`compulsive reasons for skepticism', and \`the traditions relating to the period of Guru Gobind Singh must be, in some considerable measure, set aside……,

> "The Sikh code of discipline, Rahit Maryada, and Sikh symbols were evolved during the eighteenth century as a result of gradual growth, though the tradition declares they were definitely settled by a pronouncement of Guru Gobind Singh and were a part of the Vaisakhi day proceedings in 1699 (A.D.)."

> "Though the Gurus denounced the caste system and preached against it, yet they did not seem sincere or serious in removing caste difference." 

> "The succession of Guru Granth Sahib as Guru of the Sikhs, ending the line of living Gurus on the death of Guru Gobind Singh, was not because of an injunction of Guru Gobind Singh himself, but was a subsequent adaptation by the Sikhs, who were fighting for their existence, to meet the needs of the Panth for cohesion."

> "The authenticity of the current version of Guru Granth Sahib which is widely accepted and revered by the Sikhs, is open to question, since there are three manuscripts (birs) available which are not entirely identical." 

But then again the Foundation, knows best.
