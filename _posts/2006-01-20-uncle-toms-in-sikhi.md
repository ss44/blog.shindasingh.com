During the black revolution movement of the 1960's, Malcolm X divided the black masses into two distinct categories, and defined them using his famous analogies of the house negro, and field negro. He defined them as such:

> There were two kinds of slaves, the house Negro and the field Negro. The house Negroes - they lived in the house with master, they dressed pretty good, they ate good because they ate his food - what he left. They lived in the attic or the basement, but still they lived near the master; and they loved the master more than the master loved himself. They would give their life to save the master's house - quicker than the master would. If the master said, "We got a good house here," the house Negro would say, "Yeah, we got a good house here." Whenever the master said "we," he said "we." That's how you can tell a house Negro.
> 
> If the master's house caught on fire, the house Negro would fight harder to put the blaze out than the master would. If the master got sick, the house Negro would say, "What's the matter, boss, we sick?" We sick! He identified himself with his master, more than his master identified with himself. And if you came to the house Negro and said, "Let's run away, let's escape, let's separate," the house Negro would look at you and say, "Man, you crazy. What you mean, separate? Where is there a better house than this? Where can I wear better clothes than this? Where can I eat better food than this?" That was that house Negro. In those days he was called a "house nigger." And that's what we call them today, because we've still got some house niggers running around here.
> 
> This modern house Negro loves his master. He wants to live near him. He'll pay three times as much as the house is worth just to live near his master, and then brag about "I'm the only Negro out here." "I'm the only one on my job." "I'm the only one in this school." You're nothing but a house Negro. And if someone comes to you right now and says, "Let's separate," you say the same thing that the house Negro said on the plantation. "What you mean, separate? From America, this good white man? Where you going to get a better job than you get here?" I mean, this is what you say. "I ain't left nothing in Africa," that's what you say. Why, you left your mind in Africa.
> 
> On that same plantation, there was the field Negro. The field Negroes - those were the masses. There were always more Negroes in the field than there were Negroes in the house. The Negro in the field caught hell. He ate leftovers. In the house they ate high up on the hog. The Negro in the field didn't get anything but what was left of the insides of the hog.
> 
> The field Negro was beaten from morning to night; he lived in a shack, in a hut; he wore old, castoff clothes. He hated his master. I say he hated his master. He was intelligent. That house Negro loved his master, but that field Negro - remember, they were in the majority, and they hated the master. When the house caught on fire, he didn't try to put it out; that field Negro prayed for a wind, for a breeze. When the master got sick, the field Negro prayed that he'd die. If someone came to the field Negro and said, "Let's separate, let's run," he didn't say, "Where we going?" He'd say, "Any place is better than here."

Similarly in Sikhi we have our share of house negro's (Uncle Tom's) . Lets face it, the majority of Sikhs left in Punjab and in India are Uncle Tom's. The biggest of the Uncle Toms, (there are hundreds of them), but the biggest one in my opinion has to be the renowned author Khushwant Singh.

[<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/khushwant-703395.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/khushwant-705886.jpg)I remember watching news clips, and interview's by Khushwant Singh after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, and he almost condoned the attacks, saying that the Sikhs had brought it upon themselves. Even though he was against the riots he seemed to think that the assassination of Indira Gandhi was not justified.

Now he's not the only one, their are many Sikhs who feel both sides where wrong in 84, and feel obligated to share the responsibility, just like the house negro would justify any out lash from the master as being justified.

So what are the characteristics of an Uncle Tom Sikh? Here are the few that I picked up:

  * Feel that the 84 attacks were justified and brought upon by the Sikhs.
  * That '84 is done with, time to move on with life.
  * Singhs of that era were fanatics, and where responsible for deaths of thousands of innocent.
  * Religion and Politics should never mix.
  * A really relaxed view on rehit. (Kakaars are optional type of relaxed)
  * Satkaar for Sri Guru Granth Sahib, pothis etc, is pretty low.
  * Are willing to sacrifice there pugh for a korsee.
  * Their general perception of Sikhi is something almost out of a care bear fantasy world, where violence is never necessary.
  * The view of Sikhi and promotion of Sikhi is far more left wing, just for the sake of appeasing one and all.
  * Taking Amrit is often left optional and not seen as a vital part of Sikhi.

[<img border="0" align="left" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/kalaa-744902.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/kalaa-746920.jpg)Now I could go on, as many of you could, but suffice to say you get the point. Uncle Tom's have adopted the new trend of labeling themselves as moderates, although no such thing exists. Other notorious Uncle Tom's include but are not limited to Kalaa Afganaa, Manmohan Singh, Tara Singh Hayer, etc.

Now the biggest problem with Uncle Tom's in Sikhi is that they for one promote the wrong image to the world. They have good intentions, but the means by which they go about it I totally disagree with. They are virtuous individuals, with the wrong virtues. They waste no time in trying to distance themselves against field negro Sikhs, by labeling them as fanatics and are quick to stand against them, even if it means standing with the enemy. However beyond, that the biggest problem with Uncle Tom Sikhs, is that they justify, and promote the slave mentality within the Sikh masses, (something I'll come to talk about later on in the coming weeks), however its suffice to say that due to the promotion of this mentality they end up becoming our own worst enemies.

Now, knowing that Uncle Tom's are, our own worst enemies, we need to learn to deal with them. How we do that I have no clue. Up to now it seems as though we've left them alone and just worked at ignoring them, and only when they get rowdy do we slap them on the wrist and send them running, but this does not keep them from being a nuisance, but then again it seems like the only thing worth doing.
