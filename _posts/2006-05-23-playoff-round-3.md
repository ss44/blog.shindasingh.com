Ahh, back from the long weekend and no better way to start of the new week, then with another round of playoff predictions.

Firstly lets recap Round 2, arguably one of the best rounds of playoff Basketball in a long time.

Firstly the round shocker has to be Cleveland vs Detroit. I had Cleveland in and out in 5 (if even), but Lebron being able to carry his team to 7 made me into a believer that this man-child may just be the future, and will infact live up to the label of being the phenom. I have to also agree with [Scoop Jackson](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jackson/060509), that this was a must loose series for Prince James (You can't be King until crowned with MVP's, and a championship), as he needed to experience the agony and pain of loss, to help him evolve to the next level as a player.

Anyways enough about that, its a busy day and we don't have time to waste so lets first check up on how everyone did:

Gurdeep - 2/4 + 2 bonus
  
Harsimran - 3/4
  
Atam - 2/4
  
Gagan - 2/4 + 1 bonus
  
Gurjeet - 2/4
  
Cinci - 2/4
  
Mandeep - 4/4 + 1 bonus
  
JP - 3/4
  
Kamaldeep - 3/4
  
Columbus - 2/4 - 1 (You don't post predictions when the teams up 3-1 in a series come on now)
  
Shinda - 4/4 + 2 bonus.

**Bonus points for predicting # of games.

So there's what we have going in, but that was the easy part, now we'll let this round separate the boys from the men.

How I see things:

  <strong>West</strong>

**_Phoenix_ vs Dallas**
  
I've been with Phoenix thus far, so I can't drop them now. Every one's been talking all along how Phoenix just won't be able to hold there own, which they proved they could do regardless of Amare or Kurt Thomas in the line up so I'm going to back Phoenix in this one. Not an easy pick considering the way Dallas is playing and the fact that Dallas puts the D in defense, but we can only have one winner and I'll have to go with Phoenix on this one.

<div align="center">
  <strong>East</strong>

**_Miami_ Vs Detroit**
  
The rivalry continues, with another hard pick for this round. The X-Factor I think will come down to a healthy line up, and the mob boss himself, Pat Riley (yes the coach). I can see Shaq, holding his own against Wallace after all the experienced and elder shogun will prove victorious. Wade, he's lost, he knows what it means to loose, he's got the drive, the talent and the potential, but does he have the strength? This kid gets knocked around more then Tina Turner, so you have to wonder if history will repeat itself, but just like Flash always prevails in the comics, and with the Man of Steel himself at his side, I see Wade coming at this series with vengeance. If all else fails count on the Glove aka Green Lantern to help out in what ever way he can when it comes down to it. End of the day count on the Justice League aka Heat to take this in 6.

Now as always leave your predictions and we'll see how you hold up. Gurjeet and Pindi I have to say you guys flopped in the past rounds considering the amount of gian you're expected to have on this topic. Gagan, you've let your heart and hate for individuals guide you thus far, and your results are far from impressive. Considering the time you put into watching highlights, memorizing stats I expect more from you, but alass maybe my expectations are just to high.
