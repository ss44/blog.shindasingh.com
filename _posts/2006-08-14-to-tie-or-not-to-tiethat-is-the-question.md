You know its that time of year, every year when you see the message boards [and now blogs], light up with threads on Rakhri, and how it needs to be stopped amongest Sikhs as it has nothing to do with Sikhi, its bhamin vaad, Hindu culture, etc.

Personally speaking I've never been a fan of the whole thing, and looking back as far as I can remember, I never was fond of it. Not because I felt it was against Sikhi, rather because paying $20 to my sisters for a piece of string, that I never wanted in the first place, didn't seem worth it, and most of them weren't happy with the ten cents I was willing to part with.

Nonetheless, a big deal is made every year with call for resistance of this Hindu ritual, that many believe has no place in Sikhi, whatsoever, which I question on a few fronts.

Firstly the main argument made against accepting or giving a rakhri is the fact that it shows a gender bias, with the implication that men are superior to women [hence them asking for the males protection], and thus has no value in terms of Sikhi. Yet this onus should be placed on the bibi to not give a rakhri so to not ask for protection rather then on the Singh to refuse it. Be it as it may, refusing the Rakhri on these grounds by any Singh only implies that the the Singh is refusing the gesture to give protectionon on the grounds that he feels his sister is capable of protecting herself. What if she feels the contrary, and therefore feels the need to offer this gesture, how can it then be refused. Also Singhs have long been known to be the protectors of not only their own sisters yet the wives, daughters, mothers and sisters of all people, so if those females feeling obliged to offer their brothers in arms a rakhri as a gesture asking for protection be adamantly refused? Point being, the onus should not be on the male to refuse the acceptance of this gesture rather on the individual Bibian to not make it.

Secondly, if the Rakhri should not be celebrated based on it being a cultural event then at the same time neither should birthdays in the manor that they are today. I'm not saying ban the doings of Kirtans and Sehaj Pahts that is customary among many families, but rather the whole gifts, cake, parties thing. Yet when it comes to this cultural norm there is a much more indifference to the whole matter. Same could go for Halloween, and what ever other practise one chooses to divulge in based on the customary cultural norms of there soceiy. If you're not going preach against something based on the fact that its not part of the Sikh culture then its only right that you preach and obstain against all. (Considering of course that is your argument)

Lastly, in terms of Sikhi, Rakhri isn't completly unheard of. In some Nihang Dal's its common for Singhs to ordain their Shastars with Rakhri's as a gesture of seeking protection. Of course this isn't saying that this justifies Rakhri, and may just be a consequence of 'morphing' the occasion to fit into a Sikhi mould versus being a long standing tradition coming from Guru Sahib's times, but I can't see nothing wrong or against that.

Now I agree that this is a redundant post on a subject that many of us could care less about, but I figure if it's really going to hurt someone by refusing to wear a Rakhri that they want to tie then is it really that big of a deal, not like the strings going to last more then a week if even a day, or if you're anything like me as a kid then anything more then 10 seconds after it being tied.

Actually I propose that for Singhs instead of tying Rakhri's they demand a nice Karda instead and none of this thin alluminium ones that came from the SGPC factory neither. I'm talking about those old school AKJ amrit sinchaar type. The ones that always went missing before an Amrit Sinchaar..

Finally, if any of my cousins are reading this then now you know, and knowing is half the battle. As for everyone else annoyed by the time they wasted reading this post, then just know it was equally boaring writing this, but having people tell me I hadn't updated in a while everytime you see them, really does get to you.
