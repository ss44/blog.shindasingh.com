With all the new noise coming out of Malton, Toronto, Rexdale in recent years its nice to see Brampton stepping up and adding to it, sure the lyrical content isn't <a href="http://thepoetproject.com/" target="_blank">humble</a>, but I think off all the mans spitting right now, this man seems to have the the most effortless flow... plus he's repping Turner and Wooods right, so gotta show love.
