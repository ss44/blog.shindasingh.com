As the TV was turned on at 9:10, and Jason Terry was being interviewed, the quote Who do you believe in? is still resonating in my mind. Not because it was one of Tupacs songs or one of the amazing lines in Thug Luv, however it was because of the meaning that it brought for the Miami Heat.The Basketball Gods.

When the Heat were down by 13 with 6:37 left in game three of the NBA Finals, no one thought they would win. No One. However, there was no way that I was about to turn off the Tube with that much time still left in the game. Throughout the next 20 minutes of that Tuesday, so many miraculous things happened that suggested that Gods hand was at work for the Miami Heat.

  1. With 2:12 to go in the third quarter Josh Howard scored his 20th and 21st points. The mavs were 25-0 when Howard scored 20+ points.
  2. Down by 5, Shaq gets fouled on a Dunk attempt and has to go to the line with 1:37 left. Shooting 6-22 for the series prior, he cans both of them.
  3. Gary Payton, who has been killed by JT and Harris hits the eventual most crucial-jumper of his life to put the heat up by two
  4. Dirk Nowitizki, a 94% free throw shooter misses one of his free throws with 3 seconds remaining
  5. After the missed free throw, Jerry Stackhouse has the opportunity to grab the offensive rebound, only to see Dwyane Wade come from the rafters and snatch the ball from Jerrys outstretched arms. .

Some may argue luck or coincidence, however as V said it best _I, like God, do not play with dice, and do not believe in coincidence_. There was something more to those sequences, there was a calling, a Jor-El moment with Clark, a moment of truth, a moment where the ball ends up in the hands of Robert Horry with clock winding down, or better described as: **DESTINY**
  
From that moment on, every Dallas fan and player were pleading lucky break of sequences, but not the Heat, their post game quotes were as follows:

> I'm a true believer," Riley said
> 
> "We're a team with faith in one another." Gary Payton said,
> 
> "The basketball gods were good to us." Pat Riley said
> 
> "We're a very strong-willed team, we all believe in each other when we're down and out, we always feel we can come back and individually believing in God and believing that He will give you the strength to do go out there and do it." Dwyane Wade said.

When Dirk Nowitzki was asked the question by a reporter pertaining to Rileys statement about the Basketball gods, Dirks answer is what sealed the deal for the Mavs,

> _I dont believe in that stuff_ 

Then _Who Do you believe in_?

With Shaq playing completely sub-par, Walker taking the second most shots on the team and everyone but Haslem getting killed on the Defensive end, how did the Heat win the NBA championship?

Besides the greatest MVP performance by Dwyane Wade, besides the Lock down Defense of Udonis Uber Heart Haslem, to the contrary to those speeches prepared by Pat Riley, Wade described it best when he was handed the MVP of the Finals:

> First I would like to thank God

For this championship was pre-ordained by God himself. It was put to a halt last year because the Heat didnt want it. Shaq was out of shape, Wade too young and oft injured, Damon Jones played no defense, Stan couldnt get his guys going. The look on the heat player faces as the pistons celebrated on their home court is what brought us to these finals. The fire, the will, the attitude.

Wade signing a deal with Gatorade, getting phone calls from Michael Jordan, phone calls from the chosen one.

Shaq losing 30 pounds, squashing the beef with Kobe.

Walker, Posey, J-Will and Payton sitting way in the back of the bus.

Haslem playing with a bum shoulder and giving 150%

Zowell What can I say to all the haters who did not want him to get a ring? 8 points, 6 boards, 5 blocks in 14 minutes

It was the Gary Payton lefty scoop lay-up, the D-Wade 35 ppg, the 21-25 Fts, it was the 10-0, 13-2, 13-0 runs that they went on. It was the published reports of the Heat being the Unworthy opponent, the mapping of the Parade route in Dallas. It was the summation of precedent accounts that brought the victory to the Heat.

So this championship is dedicated to the following people:

  1. People Who doubted the Heat
  2. People who said Shaq was washed up
  3. People who pushed Shaq out of LA
  4. People who jumped ship after game 2 (Yeah you know Doctor G)
  5. People who accused Riley of overthrowing Stan
  6. People who hated on Zo, GP and Walker
  7. People who thought the Heat would get swept.
  8. People who thought Lebron was better than Wade
  9. People who think that Shaq is not the greatest Centre to play the game
 10. Last and not least. People who dont believe in the Basketball Gods.

Now as I sign off with my best impersonation of a Scoop Jackson Article, let me make a few bold statements:

  * Shaq is the _Greatest Centre_ **ever**
  * Riley is the _best Coach_ **ever**
  * Wade will be the best player to play this game... In the words of Shaq _Wade is the best ever_
  * Zo is all Heart, stop hating now
  * Haslem is a Tru-Warrior
  * GP leaves with the hardware

It was Destiny, the Heat is Gods Team and it was my Team
