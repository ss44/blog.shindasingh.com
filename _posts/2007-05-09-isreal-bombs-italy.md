....not really, but they would have if this father was the president. Here's a prank call that a radio station pulled on a the parents of a listener (talk about going against the family), but anyways its a Bibi from a religious Jewish family getting the show to call in setting up the plot that she's flexing an Italian, what ensues is vulgar hilarity at its finest. 

**The following audio contains vulgar language that many of you may find to be a bit harsh on your ears, so you've been warned.** [audio:jewgirlprank.mp3] 

For those still confused, Israel **DIDN'T** bomb Italy
