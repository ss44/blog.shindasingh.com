As you can see, things are looking a little different.

For some reason or another the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, the service which I was using to host and manage my blog started to have issues (a lot of them), so I decided rather then give them time to sort things out, I'd make the jump and start using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.

I thought that the conversion would have been a lot more of a headache, but since the new version of WordPress it's as simple as logging into your blogger account via WordPress and clicking import.

When I originally created my blog, I looked at the whole WordPress vs Blogger thing and decided that even though it lacked in features, you can't go wrong with Google, (who owns Blogger), and so went that route, but as fate had it, I was bound to use word press in the end, so here I am.

I still got to redo the template and all that, and for some reason every single video has disapeared, but all that should get sorted out by the end of this week. Anyways hopefully things are back to normal for now, and I'll be back to my regularly scedhuled blogging habbits tomarrow.
