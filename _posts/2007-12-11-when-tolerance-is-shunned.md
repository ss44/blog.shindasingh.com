Tolerance is one of those things that while living in Canada is not only expected, but any act contrary is met with great scorn and public outrage in the media. Yet, it would seem that not all Canadians have come to accept 'tolerance' as being a vital corner stone of Canadian Society.

An article by Danielle Crittenden, of the National Post for instance, is shitting on the entire system because she wasn't harassed as much as she was hoping to have been by people in public or even the security detail that handled her at the airport, while wearing a burqa.

I would guess that Danielle would receive the same level of harassment by society had she chosen to conduct the same experiment having chosen to dress like a nun, but I guess that wouldn't count seeing as how it's the Muslims we're after.

Anyways check the link for the article, and also check what the French are now demanding in Quebec, .h the crazy world we live in.
