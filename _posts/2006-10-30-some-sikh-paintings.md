Most the time we see Sikhi related paintings or pictures, most of them are pretty cliche. Many of which are just knock offs from older generation paintings by Sobha Singh and others. Rare is it that you come across some new original / creative work that captures a moment, and makes it feel real.

Fortunately while finding things to do other then work I came across this flikr page which featured such original pieces. Below are a few of my personal favourites, the rest you can find on your own by checking Jatedar's flickr page @ <http://www.flickr.com/photos/kake/272657766/>.
