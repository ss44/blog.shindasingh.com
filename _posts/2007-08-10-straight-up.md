Prof. Uday Singh, has over the years earned himself a reputation of being straight with it. Whether he agrees or disagree's with you he very seldom leaves it to interpretation as to what he means and leaves no doubts about where he stands. Whether he's writing in favour of certain kakaars over others or&nbsp;against gurdwara committee's he doesn't seem to care for who he offends or airs out, but says what he feels needs to be said; whatever it is that he believes&nbsp;to be the truth.&nbsp; By all means this is a noble and even respectable trait in any person,&nbsp;even if what they say may be hard to&nbsp;swallow. since not everyone&nbsp;will always agree with what he's saying, but the fact that he's often the only one saying it the way it is needs to be said still&nbsp;needs to be respected. 

It's for that reason that Kim Bolan's latest article where she interviews Prof. Uday Singh leaves me both smirking at the fact that he said things the way many conceptualize and feel, yet have me shaking my head thinking, "damn he so shouldn't have said that", knowing full well how easily it can be misinterpreted by the general public. 

Then again, it is refreshing since I was getting tired of all the politically correct rhetoric that has started to appear all over the place.&nbsp;[You know, those interviews and quotes from Sikhs who continuously try to convince the media and the public that the Kirpan is nothing more then a symbol, that the Sikhs are far from being a martial race and try to compromise the faith at every turn.] 

Chullo, Gurparsad, it's all good, enjoy the article...

> 
> He may be the oldest Khalistan supporter in Canada and 84-year-old Uday Singh does not mince words when he talks about the struggle for a separate Sikh nation. 
> 
> Though Singh says he is financially "stretched," the retired Laurentian University math professor has for years sent a monthly cheque to the family of Inderjit Singh Reyat because he believes the convicted B.C. bomb-maker is "our Nelson Mandela." 
> 
> He also gave financial support to Air India bombing suspect Ajaib Singh Bagri during his trial. 
> 
> Despite Reyat's guilty plea in the 1985 Air India bombing, Singh believes Reyat was desperate to get out of jail and had nothing to do with Canada's worst act of terrorism, which was commemorated in Vancouver July 20 with the unveiling of a memorial in Stanley Park. 
> 
> Reyat's admission, "it appears to me, is something that was born out of his crying need to get out of jail. His admission is not necessarily a statement of fact," Singh said in a recent interview at his humble country home near Brampton, Ont. "He is our Nelson Mandela." 
> 
> Singh helped arrange the marriage of one of Reyat's daughters in 2003 to the son of the former Ontario leader of the Sikh militant group Babbar Khalsa as a way of helping Reyat's family. 
> 
> "I have every sympathy with the whole family, especially with the mother who has suffered most," Singh said. "To me, they are like a bunch of flowers, very fragrant and very well-behaved and high-quality people to me." 
> 
> Well before Singh immigrated to Canada in 1961, he already believed that Sikhs got a rough ride in India, and he is blunt about his feelings for the Hindu majority there. 
> 
> "They are our traditional enemies," he said, adding that Sikhs and Hindus cannot live on the same planet together. "Come on, no, not even as neighbours. Not even in separate countries." 
> 
> For 37 years, Singh has run a free school in Toronto, teaching Sikh children history, language and culture. His most famous student was Navdeep Bains, now a Liberal MP. He taught Bains and his wife until a few years ago. 
> 
> "I have taught many sons of my old students and now even the grandsons of my old students. But it is a good thing. For me it gives me my long life and it gives me my health." 
> 
> It was his first book, The Waning and Waxing of the Khalistan Movement, that he believes cost him his Indian passport and the chance to return home. 
> 
> "I have reason to believe it is this book (that) poisoned them against me and my passport was taken away," he said. 
> 
> In it, he outlines his relationship with all the original Canadian leaders of the movement, including those identified in connection with the Air India bombing. 
> 
> Singh said he helped Talwinder Singh Parmar - the man police identify as the suspected bombing mastermind - escape from India in 1982 after police there had accused him of murder. 
> 
> He later lost faith in Parmar's leadership, though he still believes the former Babbar Khalsa founder is innocent in the downing of Flight 182 and the murder of 331 people. 
> 
> "He suddenly popped up here ... he is now dead and he died for the nation ... But I was struck with his being unlettered, uneducated - that was striking," Singh said. 
> 
> Singh said he offered financial help to the families of Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik while they were on trial in the Air India case. Malik's family declined, but Bagri's wife took a monthly payment, he said. Both men were acquitted in March 2005 in a verdict praised by Singh. 
> 
> "No Sikh is guilty of doing that. The Hindu government got it done," he said, claiming an inquiry in Ottawa will eventually reach that conclusion despite the fact that it has so far focused on a conspiracy by Sikh terrorists from B.C. 
> 
> Singh believes that Sikhs are entitled to use arms when there is no other way to combat a problem, as the late separatist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale did before the Indian army raided the Golden Temple at Amritsar in June 1984. 
> 
> "Whatever the arms are at your disposal, my religion allows me to use them if it is the end of all other means," he said, praising Bhindranwale as the only real leader the Khalistan movement ever had. 
> 
> Singh said he doesn't understand the recent controversy over portraits in temples and parades of Sikh assassins described as martyrs because they killed political opponents in India. The portraits have every right to be on display in Canada, he said. "They did it for us. They punished the evil-doer, which is heroic," he said. 
> 
> The Sikh separatist movement in Canada will rise up again, Singh said, referring to the title of his book. 
> 
> "It is not dead at all," he said. "It is waning now, only to wax. It is like you are in a swing - you go down and up again."</blockquote>
