So I figured I'd do the same, but using my blog (msn space) as a reference to see what happened instead. So here we go:

* * *

**January**</p> 

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Untitled-11-780013.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 187px; height: 114px;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Untitled-11-772402.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The year started of on a somber note, with the passing of Baba Ji, and with Dhumma being elected as the new mukhi. This paved the way for the countless Dhumma jokes, and the predictions of what would become of Taksal in the coming years. So far some of those predictions have come to pass, such as :<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/pun4-741070.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 103px; height: 134px;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/pun4-739069.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>

  * Taksal has become the laughing stock for many.
  * Dhumma declared Sant Ji Shaheed.
  * A lot of the top Singhs where given the boot as the new regime took over.
  * Dhumma and Mann Singh became the best of friends.

Apart from that it also saw the start of Shinda Singh blogging, with the creation of my msn space.

**February**
  
Not much seemed to happen in February. JaRai was in the paper for his suspension and involvement in a fight that led to some people having broken heads, but the school had now recovered from it and was moving forward in racial harmony. 

Also it was at this time that SOF 2 was being played in full force. Countless nights where wasted with 8 player team death match's. Now those where the days.

**March**

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/bagri_malik_cp_7292052-710185.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 117px; height: 106px;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/bagri_malik_cp_7292052-707997.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>

The most anticipated and somewhat controversial Air India Verdict was passed, finding Malik and Bagri innocent. This later led to questions on what happened, not only on that day, but during the investigation. Was it the GOI involved in the greatest cover up? or did Malik and Bagri get away with the perfect crime? 

<p style="font-weight: bold;">
  April
</p>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/popejp-704317.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 136px; height: 107px;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/popejp-702566.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>

The biggest thing to happen in April was that the Pope passed away, but more importantly it marked the return of Wince Carter to Toronto when New Jersey played Toronto in Toronto. 

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/burnningcarter-709545.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/burnningcarter-703869.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>

The fans were booing like crazy, and Vince couldn't touch the ball without the sneers of the thousands of fans in attendance. Biggest memory of this night was the burning of the Vince Carter jersey's outside the ACC. 

How long will it take before fans realize that Vince was the greatest thing to happen to Toronto basketball since the Raptors were founded in 95??

In other side notes, apparently UK Nihangs, namely Parmjit Singh, thought they had balls showing up to Toronto and holding some conference of some sort. This led to a stand off apparently with Singhs of Tapoban? End of the day I could care less as to what happened didn't seem like much of a big deal other then on message boards.

**May**

May, marked the time of year when I started watching 24. With school out of the way I had some free time, and was able to watch the first 2 seasons. This show was buck. It was because of the fact that the first 2 seasons got so addicting that I restrained myself from watching Seasons 3 and 4. This show opened my eyes to many things.

Season 1 taught me that- Bibian are stupid.
  
Season 2 taught me that - Bibian are stupider then i thought.

_*When i say bibian i mean girls and females in general._

**June**

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/img2-761782.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/img2-756745.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>With school done, I was working full time for Halton MP [Gary Carr](http://www.garycarr.ca). According to my blog, it was during this time that I was walking around in the sweltering heat, dropping of pamphlets to the residents of Milton and Oakville. With the way things where going at work, I thought I was in for a long summer of outdoor fun, but the drops only lasted for this month and a bit of July, until the heat became to intense, that I found myself once again behind a computer doing data entry, in front of the filing cabinets taking care of the filing, or at the desk folding letters and stuffing pamphlets.

June also marked the start of my workout regime, with Bougaloo, Nutso and Rastafied Randy at Primier Fitness. Our original workout routine was to go to the gym one day then go swimming the next. This lasted about two weeks, until taking kesi every other night, became a hassle.
  
Rundeep also ended up taking off to India with Ja, and Gurjeet, and due to Bougaloo not wanting to swim, we ended up just going to the gym everyday instead. 

It was also in this month that I took the time to finish reading Malcolm X's autobiography. (A book, which I highly recommend everyone read at least once.) 

<span style="font-weight: bold;">July</span>

This was probably the time of the year when I was most bored. I reach that conclusion based on the number of blog entries I had on some days. So many so that I had to take a break and back away from the whole thing for a bit. Apart from my daily rantings and thoughts, this month had some considerable accomplishments.

For one, I passed my G level driving test. My G2 expired in June, and after having failed my driving test twice, I was able to get a temporary 1 month extension, and luckily got through my G test on my third and final chance. (Another incident caused due to procrastination).

I also started playing GTA San Andrea's. Being hooked on the GTA franchise ever since part 1, (the overhead camera and all), I have to say this is the best installment yet, and I'll even go as far as saying the best video game ever to date. I wasted countless hours on this, but then again if you ever saw this game, you would two.

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> August</p> 

<p>
  </span>Ohhh August, how though art a blur. As you may be able to guess from the last line, August was pretty busy. So lets being.
</p>

<p>
  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sopranos-760873.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sopranos-758400.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
</p>

<p>
  Firstly it was in August that I completed watching and got caught up with the Soprano's. Having always enjoyed mob and gangster movies, this show was a God send. Although it took me some time to get caught up, Soprano's quickly became one of my favourite TV shows of all time. Right up there with 24, Ninja Turtles and Fresh Prince.
</p>

<p>
  I also completed a demo/beta version of the <a href="www.gursikhijeevan.com/community/gindex/">Gurdwara Index</a> found on <a href="http://www.gursikhijeevan.com">Gursikhi Jeevan.</a> Wasn't really all that hard either considering all I had to do was make an XML page, then feed that into the Map API as per the google documentation, but I was able to complete it all the same.
</p>

<p>
  One of the many highlights of August, was that the Toronto Khalsa/Kharkoo's won their first international tournament after 7 years of trying. It took a while but with the team at full health and all cancers removed the team pulled together as a cohesive unit to pull it off. (The addition of some new perimeter shooters also helped.)
</p>

<p>
  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/DSCF5421-796007.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/DSCF5421-787191.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
</p>

<p>
  One of the on going highlights as always was Yudh (2005). This marked Yudh's 3rd year, and although it had its share of controversy, it also saw the most Gatka Baj's from outside of Toronto. With competitors from Houston, Cali, Ottawa and BC. This year a new champ was crowned, with Harpreet Singh from Cali. Harpreet Singh dominated with what I've come to call his calm cobra style of play. Lets hope next years is better, as I'm sure we'll see new faces (with the return of old).
</p>

<p>
  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/jpcamp1-771187.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/jpcamp1-768865.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
</p>

<p>
  Of course no summer isn't complete without a Gurmat camp. This summer we held two. One at the beginning of summer (June or July) at Mississauga. (I didn't mention it, because I wasn't involved in it at all), and the second at Jot Parkash.
</p>

<p>
  The camp went all right, and Bhai Amardeep Singh Calgary Wale came down again to help out. Saw a few new faces, which is always good. I think for this year, its time to start holding camps outside of the GTA and also start working on camps for the older youth.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">September</p> 
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Firstly, I'd like to congratulate you for reading this far. Thank you for putting up with my bad spelling and grammer. Taking your time to really read this means nothing to me, but its always good to know that someone out there is being entertained by my useless rantings. Now keep going, as there's not much left.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sunnyandsukhcamp-794208.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sunnyandsukhcamp-759236.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /> A new chapter begins, as I move out to begin school in Ottawa. I got me a nice apartment hear and things are safe so far. It is also here, where I'm going to give a shout out my roommates Baba Tejdeep Singh and Bhai Ranjit Sion. No doubt this chapter begins with me running from the police care of Sunny and Sukhs bright idea to have a fireworks battle in the middle of no where. (I swear I'm getting to old for this.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Coming to Ottawa gave me a break from Toronto life, so no real events to talk about here. I got to know the Ottawa Sangat also commonly referred to as the <a href="http://www.OttawaSikhYouth.ca">Ottawa Sikh Youth</a>, and so thats really as far as things go as for September.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It was at this time also that, Nutso also ventured to the Islands, to start schooling to become an MD.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">October</p> 
    
    <p>
      </span>Friday sports is probably now the highlight of each week. Every week a bunch of us get together and play indoor soccer. The teams have been divided so its Carleton Vs the World. Or as the teams refer to themselves as the Khalistani Soccer Force vs Guru Dey Laal. Each week the two teams go head to head in a series of games all upto 3. The team with the most wins by the end of the 2 hour time period, wins for the night, sending the loosing team home to remember Bani. Currently Guru dey Laal lead the league 3-2.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Smallville premiered bringing with it the weekly Smallville review. So far this Seasons been upto par with the last Season, which was one of the best. Hopefully the show will continue this way, and end on a high note.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/balpreetkirpan-709523.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 85px; height: 123px;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/balpreetkirpan-705175.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>On a more serious note, it was in October when the drama and ignorance over the Kirpaan reared its ugly head once again. This time against Bhai Balpreet Singh. Apparently some passengers on VIA felt threatened by Balpreet's appearance. Although everyone thought that Balpreet was making the right move by taking things to the media, lessons where learned when the Ottawa Citizen took a conservative stance putting the Kirpaan and Balpreet in the publics cross hairs, but gurparsaad all this will come to pass soon enough. (Waiting on the Supreme Court).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">November</p> 
      
      <p>
        </span>Nothing of any real notice happened this month. Just the normal: school, chill, repeat.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The NBA season started which off course means the start of our annual Fantasy league. Although I missed the draft, because of Diwali I've still managed to keep my team tight.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Waterloo Kirtan Darbaar happened, and that was all right. Gave me a chance to meet up with my family in the Loo, as did the '84 candle light vigil. Not much to really say about either of these functions that hasn't already been said.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sanga-gurprit-749298.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/sanga-gurprit-739009.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>On a side note, both Baba Sangha, and Bhai Surjit Singh got married. Sangha in Cali, and Surjit Singh in Toronto. I spent my whole Sunday that I was in Toronto running around with Shaheed, trying to prepare wedding cards for Surjit Singhs wedding. (And I thought I procrastinated). Although I missed the wedding, I'm sure it went good.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On another note Raagi Harpaal Singh, graced us up here in Ottawa, and I was able to meet with both them and Bhai Joginder Singh. The last time I remember meeting either Singh was in NY with Baba Ji, (summer 2004).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">December</p> 
        
        <p>
          </span>Yes, Yes yall we almost there.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          December was kept busy with the likes of exams and assignments as the semester came to a close.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Back in Toronto for the holidays, I was kept busy with the 1st Barsi of Sant Baba Takhur Singh Ji, and also the Youth Gurmat Camp. All the while I tried my best to squeeze in time with the family.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I wasn't able to do all that I planned, primarily help out on a campaign or two, and also visit regularly with Baba Bhagat Ji, but with so much going on, one can only remember that this is a time to relax before school starts up again.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          December also marked the beginning of this blog, which hopefully is still around come next the end of the year.
        </p>
        
        <hr />
        Other things that happened that I didn't mention include,</p> 
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale broke <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/dhadrianatmalton-709797.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 115px; height: 86px;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/dhadrianatmalton-705082.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>all records on the West coast. Jam packing Malton to the point where they eventually had to start doing the diwans outside in the parking lot, and even then every single inch of road was filled. Apparently the same happened on the West Coast.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beadbi <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/beadbisaroop-751633.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 126px; height: 94px;" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/beadbisaroop-747578.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. A Mahraaj saroop was found in a Scarborough park, cut to shreds and soiled by mud and rain. (Two Bibian eventually came forward and took responsibility for the Beadbi)
          </li>
          <li>
            Gurdwara Sahib Jot Parkash's grand opening. The Gurdwara Sahib started to go under development in around January, and to look at it before and after, quite a lot has happened in its development since then. Hopefully all construction and renovation's will be complete come this summer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          So there you have it folks. Shinda's year in review. I'd like to congratulate you all on getting this far, and can only hope that next year I do the smart thing and start writing this review a week earlier, dividing it up into several days worth of reading, rather then dumping it on you all at once.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Not wanting to write anything more, I say god bless, peace and happy new year to one and all...
        </p>
