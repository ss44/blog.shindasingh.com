If you don't know him yet, let me introduce you to Subaig Singh (2 - 0 -0), a gursikh MMA fighter coming out of the UK. Staying true to his name ( "Mightiest of em all" Â [?] ) he's gone 2 an 0 so far in the local circuit.

While the bigger promotions maybe still far off, the fact that a Singh is throwing down in the cage will hopefully act as an inspiration for others to also step their training up. Pending that he stays healthy and continues to get quality training, its not far off to expect Singh to be part of the big show in the near future.

For now though its on the community to back such talent so be sure to throw him a shout on his [facebook fan page](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=144697108614), follow him on [twitter (@subaigsingh)](http://twitter.com/subaigsingh) [updated], visit his website [[subaigsingh.com](http://subaigsingh.com)] and if possible go watch him fight live.

For now though, rumble young man rumble.
