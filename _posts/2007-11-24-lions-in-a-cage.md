Seems like Kimbo has evolved to become more then just a YouTube street fighter, who fought for a a small purse to having finally entered the cage/ring to put his talents to their real test.

The fight itself wasn't all that spectacular but this clip really did help sell things:



Anyways, it'll be interesting to see how Kimbo fairs in the long run. I'd love to see him and Houston Alexander get it on, seeing as how they both started out as back street brawlers.

P.s - Who would have guesssed that training with Bas Ruten helped Kimbo develop a ground game, never thought that I'd see the day when Kimbo won a fight via submission, on the ground.
