Sources report that earlier this morning PindGagan was bombed by muslim extremists. So far no causalities have been reported but the Pind has been left with a new home page and all posts seem to have gone missing. Rescue efforts are now in place to try and recover any posts and rescue teams are optimistic that the there were no causalities but note it is still to early to tell.

Sarchpan Gagan himself could not be reached for comment, but it sources cite that the Sarchpanch was no where near the pind as he was last reported to have been vacationing in the sunny side of Malton, as little as a week ago.

A group known as the Mor0can Islam Defenders Team has taken credit for the attack, but home land security has yet to take any course of action citing that for the time being this is a rescue operation, and all subsequent acts will occur at Sarpanch Gagan's discretion.

Meanwhile an amber alert has been raised for all like sites to perform backups and secure there data as such attacks are always unpredictable, this attack comes in light of another suicide bombing that left several Sikh sites including COSS and Sikhs Against Genocide crippled just last year.
