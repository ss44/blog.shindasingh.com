The more bani we read the better. I remember back in the old Malton day's we would pick a Gurpurbh, and collectively as a Friday class, everyone would do a determined amount of Mool Mantar Pahts. (It was usually something like 10, 000 each) and everyone got a counter to keep track. Come time of the Gurpurbh, an ardass was done for the collective amount of Mool Mantar bani that was completed. Now I fail to see how that is anti gurmat. The more bani you read the better. Same argument goes for when people question why Jap Ji Sahib or Jaap Sahib are done continuously alongside Akhand Pahts, claiming its pointless and anti gurmat. The more bani you read the better period.

The discussion later took an expected turn, when Mann Singhs not so distant past showed up into the discussion. The main argument by those who support Mann Singh to this day, is that those who made the accusations, Kulbir Singh and their families have since left Sikhi and can not be taken as credible sources. That entire argument is flawed and instead proves why Kulbir Singh and family <span style="font-weight: bold;">can </span>be taken seriously.

I personally knew Kulbir Singh for the longest time growing up, after all they where the ones who came up with the idea of starting a Friday class at Malton. They would teach and inspire those who had yet to take Amrit, to take it, and would always try to share whatever insight they had on Sikhi with us. When the classes started our core guys where in grades 7 and 8, and the classes continued well into our high school years, when in turn the seniors of the class started to take a more active role in preaching to the young'ins, as Kulbir Singh was tight on time after having his own new born at home. In hind-sight a lot of what was taught, sakhi's etc. was from the Diwaans of Mann Singh, who Kulbir Singh was really loyal and close with. I can honestly say at that time Kulbir Singh was ready to take bullets for Mann Singh if the occasion ever came up.

Its because of that loyalty and shardaa that Kulbir Singh had towards Mann Singh that the whole argument breaks up. For someone who followed Mann Singh so closely to then realize the truth behind them, shattered their world, and in turn made everything Mann Singh spoke a lie. This went as far and as deep as to effect their Sikhi, after all, it was Mann Singh who preached to them daily about the importance and greatness of Sikhi to begin with. It was because of Mann Singhs betrayal that, things resulted the way they did.

This isn't the first time it has happened, nor will it be the last. Many people who have had the misfortune of attaching themselves to fake Sadhs, have later had their hearts ripped out when they realize it was all a scheme. It is for this reason that true Mahpurkh, such as Sant Harnaam Singh, would take people who had attached themselves to their feet and instead attach them to the feet of the immortal Guru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib Jee.

As for going to the Akal Takht, Singhs approached Jatehdar Vedanti, a few years back in Toronto, about having Baba Mann Singh ex-communicated from the Panth. Jatehdar Vedanti made note, that cases like this are not new and there have been many accusations in the past about other precharaks. They told the sakhi of how Akal Takhat had excommunicated a Precharak in the past on the claims of a Bibi for having raped her, but then later came to learn that the Bibi was in fact part of the RSS and was part of a larger scheme to destroy this individuals image, so unless video proof or something more concrete other then the word of an individual came to light, they couldn't do anything about it. Even, Mann Singhs closest gurvai left them, after apparently witnessing and learning the truth about Mann Singh.

To me this is reminiscent of The Nation of Islam, and Elijah Mohammad. Malcom X used to be down to die for Mohammad, and even when people where making accusations all along, he would deny and denounce them. However after time he came to see the truth himself, and he himself felt like he was betrayed by the one thing, and person who gave him life. However, after going to Mecca and seeing a whole different view of Islam, Malcolm realized that the work he was doing wasn't in vain, just a bit of course, and continued to do the work he was doing. In the same way, one can only hope that those who where ill effected by such precharaks will one day, see that Sikhi really is all that it is made out to be and again continue on serving the Panth.<!-- // Begin Pollhost.com Poll Code // -->
