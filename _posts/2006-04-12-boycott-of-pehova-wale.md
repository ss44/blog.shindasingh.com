It seems like the effect of those Akhand Pahts has already begun to take shape as Mann Singh has recently been boycotted and barred from [holding diwans on stages in Dubai](http://www.sanjhsavera.com/apr_0606.html#1) where the Sangat rejected his presence and similarly now Mann Singh has been boycotted from the various stages in New York in the tri state area.

> **Press Release
  
> New York Sikh Sangat takes Hard Stance against Mann Singh Pehovawale**
> 
> New York - Gurdwara Committees and Panthic Jathedbandi's of the Tri State area held a meeting at the Sikh Cultural Society Gurdwara where problems facing the Sikh community and panth were discussed, including the upcoming New York tour by Mann Singh Pehova wale. All Jathebandhi's and committees took special notice about Mann Singhs upcoming tour and made note of his previous tours, where Mann Singh has been known to give the wrong meanings and use gurbani out of context in such a way that it is inappropriate to discuss in front of our mothers, sisters, and daughters.
> 
> The pending crimes reported by the various press in India, and in North America, regarding the inappropriate meetings between Mann Singh and young women were also looked at and discussed. It was noted that Panthic Jathedar of Akaal Takhat Bhai Ranjeet Singh hade made and collected video statements which were then released to the media. In these videos the girls revealed the nature and extent of the crimes of sexual harassment by Mann Singh, to various Panthic bodies, yet no action has yet been taken, by these leaders. Many of Mann Singhs close associates have also been active in shedding light on the disgraceful acts committed by him. The relevance of Mann Singhs close association with and honoring of corrupt leaders and the smooth operation of his deras was also discussed. Other pending issues were also brought up and resolved.
> 
> It was concluded that at every program by Mann Singh, from his arrival at the airport would be attended by Sangat wishing to enlighten others of his actions. The proposal to make and distribute pamphlets outlining the activities of Mann Singh was also taken into consideration.
> 
> The collective majority of attendees pressed for action on another issue. They wished for Mann Singhs presence at Mukhan Shaah Lubhaana Gurudwara, the only committee still wishing to support his programs, should be discussed with the respective committee and a humble request be made to cancel the planned program. Worldwide media coverage and attention given to the activities of Mann Singh has still not resulted in a statement or even acknowledgement from Mann Singh, and this should suffice in the boycott of all his programs from all Gurudwaras. Those who fell victim to his actions should be helped in all ways possible and it should be the duty of all Sikhs to use the highest means of support in encountering the injustice they faced. An eleven member committee was formed in regards to this.
> 
> Upon reaching these conclusions, the committee of Mukhan Shaah Lubhaana Gurudwara was contacted and they assured sevadaars that Mann Singhs programs would take place only at the Gurudwara itself, and nowhere outside. They expressed regret that they had not been contacted earlier as they would have made arrangements to cancel his programs. Senior leader of Gurudwara Mukhan Shaah Lubhaana, Master Mohinder Singh proposed the idea that the Sikh community should sit down and find a proper and permanent solution to this problem so that future fake Babas are not allowed entrance into any Gurudwara. He simultaneously putt a certain amount of blame on the Sangat for giving such inapt individuals such credibility and merit in so little time, with no prior knowledge and forgetting all maryada and respect for Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Master Ji said he gives Sangat full support and applauds their efforts in regards to this issue.
