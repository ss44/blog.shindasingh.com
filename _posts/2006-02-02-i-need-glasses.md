So I'm writing this test for some next class, and I'm sitting there and it was a pure scene. I did the multiple choice in like 2 secs, and after that I got sick faded, because they wanted these next essay questions and i was like left it, ill fade. So I started stressing then got Kirpaa and Guru Sahib gave me next darshan of the mans sitting in front of me, and I was like ill, i'm set. So i start looking and was pure trying to cop that, and the shit on his paper was sick blurry, and I was like ahhhhhh damn menu enkaan chidee ah. Sick fade, got pure raped.

Have trouble reading/understanding the above? ah well thats a sick fade...haha gotta love Turner Boli...
