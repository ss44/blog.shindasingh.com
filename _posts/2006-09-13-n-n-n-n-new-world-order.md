I was recently [asked to comment](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=284#comment-3796)/write about the victory of the youth slate as they won the Gurdwara elections for New Westminister Gurdwara, incidently enough I wanted to mention it before but being tight on time, never did get around to it. 

<a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/WindowsLiveWriter/NnnnNewWorldOrder_9B44/coloured_AD_Sikh_Youth_New_West%5B5%5D.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="240" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/WindowsLiveWriter/NnnnNewWorldOrder_9B44/coloured_AD_Sikh_Youth_New_West_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg" width="165" align="right" border="0" /></a> Firstly, [congratulations to those who won](http://www.newfuture.ca/), and those who supported the cause. I don't know much about the people involved, let alone the situation, but overall it seems like a positive change. At the same time the concept of a youth slate got me thinking more about things in Toronto and how a youth slate would apply here. 

From my experience there hasn't been any real conviction by the youth to get involved in the local Gurdwara politics, at the same time though I havn't seen much need for it either. Most Gurdwara Sahibs, be it Malton, Dixie, Mississauga, Rexdale or Jot Parkash at one time or another do what they can to support the youth. That's not to say there hasn't been frustration at time over the amount of support given, or in what manour, let alone the politics played with who gets support versues who doesnt, but for the most part things seem ok. At the same time most Gurdwara Sahibs in one form or another have/encourage youth involvement, by having youth representatives work with them be it in the form of a commitee membership or simply as liasons. 

Be that as it may, I'm still left to wonder what&nbsp;a youth slate in Toronto would look like, who would be a part of it, and how much support it would get, not only from the youth but in general sangat. For example take Dixie, the biggest Guru ghar in North America, and known for its elections. In Toronto right now there are 3,4 major parties that are involved on a political level in some shape or form running to run the big show. At the same time most youth in Toronto are in some way shape or form linked knowingly or unknowingly in some way to the above parties. In most cases its by family association while for others&nbsp;its a&nbsp;particular party that&nbsp;supported or continues to support them in one way or another even if it is just in the means of providing a venue.

Now with that as it is, several questions also come to mind in regards to any said youth slate. Would the youth really rally behind a youth slate at any of the major gurdwara's? Would a youth slate be able to exist free of elders from one of the major parties not trying to pull the strings? and last but not least, would the youth be inept in understanding the larger demographic nature of the Gurdwara Sahibs, and compete with the elder generation on the same level.

Who knows, but there's&nbsp;my post for&nbsp;the week..
