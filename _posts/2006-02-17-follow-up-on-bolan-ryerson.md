Not to long ago, I wrote about [Kim Bolan coming to Ryerson](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2006/01/choosing-our-battles.html) to do a lecture, and how an effort should be made to confront her during her program and challenge her on the various things she has written.

Although last minute, considering exams and the hectic schedule of most students at this time of year, a good group of about 20-25 students were able to attend the _lecture,_ on behalf of various downtown SSAs ([York](http://york.sikhstudents.ca/), [Ryerson](http://ryerson.sikhstudents.ca/) etc) and [COSS](http://www.sikhstudents.ca/). I was able to talk with 4, 5 of the Singhs who attended, and they told me that it was an all right showing considering the time they had to put things together.

Basically the whole lecture was Bolan reading the preface of [her book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/077101130X/sr=8-1/qid=1140204576/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-5359906-6292907?%5Fencoding=UTF8) verbatim, after which question period commenced and the Sagnthaa(n) challenged her on various points.

[<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/KimBolanFINALONLINE-762641.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/KimBolanFINALONLINE-764880.jpg)Questions ranged from her journalistic approach, (_coming at the Air India story with the bias that she did),_ and also her inability to detach herself from the story which she had became evidently emotionally attached with. Her negativity towards the Sikh Religion and community were also questioned as were her motives behind the slander that she writes.

For the most part the questions remained as respectable as could have been expected, considering that no threats were made, and for duration Bolan side stepped the questions, either refusing to answer or shaking her head and saying we are all entitled to our own opinions.

After dominating the question period Bolan basically told the Singhs, that she had, had enough of their questions and that she was not there to talk about her writings rather Guerilla Journalism basically saying _leave me the $@$@ alone._ Many then decided to get up and leave taking the 2 undercovers assigned to watch over them, out with them.

Anyways, the objective of at least confronting her was accomplished. Sure more hard and concrete claims against her would have made her look worse, but being one of those last minute things, and the fact that as a community we havent really done much literarily to counter her only impedes(d) that.

I know of Singhs who have been following the writings of Bolan, and others who after this encounter decided that it we necessary that we go through and highlight articles from her stories where she defames the community. Some Singhs have decided to go ahead with such projects come summer, when time is more readily available, and school no longer a factor.

(If anyone has already started such a project or collection, do share your findings or at least share what you have so far, so that instead of working against each other yall can work together and speed things up.)

Anyways, there was also some media coverage of the event, by [The Toronto Star](http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&amp;cid=1139957412935&call_pageid=968350130169&col=969483202845) (Torontos major paper), and off course the [Ryersonian](http://stw.ryerson.ca/%7Esonian/feb15/news/bolan.html) (Ryerson Student paper).

Also check out the [COSS website](http://www.sikhstudents.ca/) for images and probably even a release on the topic.
