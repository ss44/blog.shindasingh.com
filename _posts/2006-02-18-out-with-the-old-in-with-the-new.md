Ever since Vince dominated the dunk competition in 2001, the dunk competition has never been up to par. The leagues tried to make it interesting, coming up with new ideas and almost a new set of rules each year, but lets face it, the dunk competition is played out, until at least the next bright new star comes around and pulls of something so creative that weve never seen it or even thought that such a feat was possible (even after NBA Live).

But thats not to say that the Skills competition is all dead. Far from it, instead from the dunk competitions ashes a new highlight has risen, and finally been given the attention it so long deserved, thats right folks the 3 point competition is the new thing to watch for.

Sure the dunk competition was fun to watch, but its just not near as exciting as the 3 point shootout and how could it be. A missed dunk (or 9 in the case of the Birdman) usually means that the dunk you finally do manage to connect with is less dramatic and far from exciting as the original would have been, but those same rules dont apply to the 3 point competition. Sure a missed shot spells doom, but it doesnt kill the moment like a missed dunk does.

Anyways I could go on, but its all star weekend, why over analyze these things, and after last nights performance at the Rookie game, the dunk competition isnt all dead, after all who knows what young Iguodala has up his up his sleeves, I think this kid will impress and maybe even make a believer of me yet.
