There is a lot of anger and hatred towards LeBron for a variety of reasons. Some of it is because of the way that he left Cleveland and their fans while for others it’s because of jealousy and there are some who just like to hate. Personally, I don’t mind that he joined the Heat. He was a free agent and that was his choice but I will say that unless he wins as many titles as MJ his place in history will always be debated because of this decision.  People will always point to the fact he had a Finals MVP in his prime to play with and this generation of NBA fans will never forget that.

I think as fans we want the players to win based on our criteria. We want you to win but only if you do it the way we want it to be done. Anything different is blasphemy. If LeBron took a team without much talent (the Cavs) and won even a ring his place in history would be much different because we would argue that he took a lackluster team and won it all but now that he actually has a team with talent it’s not right.

As a player LeBron made the right decision. He went to the team that will give him the greatest chance of winning a NBA title and if you think you wouldn’t have done the same then you’re lying to yourself. Anytime you play ball you always want to win or at least that’s the way I play. You always want the best player on your team so you have the greatest chance of winning and never coming off that court until the runs end. That’s exactly what LeBron did with this move. He gave himself the best chance to stay on the court and never coming off.

The next discussion regarding the Heat always leads to "Whose team is this?" That’s a question being asked by everyone from GMs to casual fans. Will it belong to the two time MVP or the Finals MVP? The only thing everyone can agree on is that it’s definitely not CB4s team. Many people seem to have the consensus that it is Wade’s team because he didn’t leave his team and he’s been here. He’s the incumbent. Also it seems to be a foregone conclusion that the team belongs to the person who takes the last shot and that will most likely be Wade. Also people don’t want it to be LeBron’s team because to them he is Robin to Wade’s Batman. The hatred of LeBron is so strong that it will cloud their judgment and make Kobe look like a Saint.

While there are many valid arguments to saying this will be Wade’s team I beg to differ. I think this team will belong to LeBron because this team will take the identity of LeBron. Throughout the history of the NBA, majority of teams belonged to one player, took that one player’s identity and that one player usually won the Finals MVP as well. In the ‘80s, the Lakers were Magic’s team. As good as Kareem and Worthy were (both Finals MVP as well) that team went the way Magic did. He had the ball in his hands, he made the plays and the offense was run through him. It was the same case with Bird and the Celtics, the Bulls with MJ, Spurs with Duncan, the early 2000 Lakers with Shaq and late 2000 Lakers with Kobe. The only instance where this wasn’t true was with the Pistons in ’89, ’90 and ’04. And even when Tony Parker won the Finals MVP that team still belonged to Duncan. (By the way, that was one of the biggest travesties in Finals voting ever.)

This current Heat is being run through LeBron. He will be playing PG and orchestrating the offense and this team’s identity. Whatever way LeBron turns that’s how this team will turn. As good as Wade is he will not be putting his identity and his stamp on this team because LeBron will do for this team so much more then Wade can. Other teams main focus will be LeBron first and Wade second and that should tell you as much as you need to know. In the end it’s always fun to speculate on what will happen but this year it will actually be even more fun to watch what is happening. Since I’ve started watching the NBA, I don’t think I’ve ever been as excited to watch a team play as this Heat team and I’m positive that they will not disappoint… no matter whose team it is.
