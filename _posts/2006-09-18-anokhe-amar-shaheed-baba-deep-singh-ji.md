Last Friday, I got to go&nbsp;check out Anokhe Amar Shaheed Baba Deep Singh Ji, that primiered in theaters. Suprinsigly enough the movie was being played at Famous Players Silver City, and from the ad's I saw in the papers is being carried by a lot of the big screen famous player theaters around town, pretty impressive for a dharmic movie.<a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/WindowsLiveWriter/AnokheAmarShaheedBabaDeepSinghJi_8BD7/deepsingh%5B2%5D.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="175" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/WindowsLiveWriter/AnokheAmarShaheedBabaDeepSinghJi_8BD7/deepsingh_thumb.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></a> 

As far as Dharmic movies go, this was probabbly one of the best ones I've seen produced so far. Considering that nearly all Dharmic films are low budget and that they got there own obstacles, (as far as character's go and all that). The movie did a good job creativly in getting around these things.&nbsp;

The acting is what you can expect from such films, some was good, a lot was bad, with the biggest problem off course being the over-acting of some characters, but then again given some time I'm sure this will get better. Fight scenes, were at best bollywood-esque, but then again maybe it's to soon to expect an amritdhari Jet Lee style action hero. With all that said, what made this movie the best dharmic movie to date, is simply the sakhi of Shaheed Baba Deep Singh Ji is worth accolades on its own, if a writer were to&nbsp;try to write about it, an artist to try&nbsp;and depict it, then even that honest attempt would bring them praise, regardless of all other short comings. Along with the comedy interjections this movie remained bareable to watch, and helped make it not feel like the 2 hours and 30 minutes that it turned out to be. For those never exposed to ithyaas, and espeically children not yet exposed to Hollywood blockbusters then I'm sure that they'll get a kick out of it and take the most away from this movie, but I can't imagine&nbsp;being a&nbsp;12 year old&nbsp;and being able to sit through the entire thing, without getting restless.

For those concerned about depictions of Baba Deep Singh Ji by an actor etc, then take peace in knowing that the film makers did a good job in working around this&nbsp;by acting around it. Whenever&nbsp;a scene needed to show Baba Ji, sketch's were brought in, and the actors would then paraphrase the events of what they were seeing and hearing. 

The thing that really annoyed me with the whole film was the costumes. They were just too clean. You'd expect Singhs living in jungles to have a little more dirt/fade on there chola's, but instead everyone was rocking sparkling bright blue or oranage and in the case of the moghuls green, as if they had a never ending supply of Oxy clean. 

In the same regard the one thing worth noting was that all the Singhs used in the movie had _real_ dharis, watch some of the other movies and you'll notice the rented Santa Clause beards that the actors got on.&nbsp; Real is always good.

Overall, the movie by no means is a blockbuster, but should be checked out to at the very least to at the very least aknowledge and support the effort made by the film makers, and hopefully inspire other creative, and better peices such as this one in the future.
