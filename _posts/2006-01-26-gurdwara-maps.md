The other day I was checking out [AshSinghs blog](http://www.ashsingh.com/) and he was featuring a new project of his, which utilized the Google Map API.

Similarly a while ago, I was able to work on a similar project for [GursikhiJeevan](http://www.gursikijeevan.com/), when we made the [Gurdwara Index.](http://www.gursikhijeevan.com/community/gindex/)

[<img width="245" height="140" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/gmap2-710411.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/gmap2-714651.jpg)Apart from looking cool, such Gurdwara maps also help show some traits about the Sikh population in different areas. For instance let each Nishaan Sahib represent about 100 Sikh families. So for every nishaan sahib you can take that as meaning that there are 100 Sikh families in a 20 km radius of that Gurdwara.

Check out Ontario for instance, you can easily see that the majority of the Sikh population in Ontario lives in the GTA. With Sangat scattered around with some in Ottawa, some in Kitchener etc.

If any of you ever played StartCraft, youll remember that in order to build anything with the Protoss, you needed to first build a Crystal, and then you could build within a given radius of it.

It seems like the same applies for Sikhs, because we only exist in and around our Gurdwaras. So whats this mean? Well, like the old saying goes, _if you build it they shall come,_ same applies for our communities. If they build the Gurdwara then Sangat is bound to follow.

Now imagine that, an AKJ International Smagaam in Hawaii, thats one Smaggam outside of Toronto that I wouldnt mind hitting up.

So what was the point of all this? Nothing really, I jus wanted to try out this new blogger word plugin that lets you blog from word. So if your reading this, then well it worked. Good stuff.
