  It seems as if Dwayne Wade has been thrown into this years MVP race by everyone. And, surprisingly, a lot of people actually have D-Wade as their MVP. Which not only shocks me, but also pisses me off.

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <p class="MsoNormal">
    First off, I got nothing against Wade. I got mad love for the Prince of South Beach. My beef is you can’t crown him MVP for leading this Miami Heat to the playoffs if you couldn’t award my man Kobe in 2006 for doing something even more spectacular. Don’t worry I got facts to back up each of my bias opinions so keep your granny panties on.

                                          So after seeing all that you’re telling me Dwayne Wade is the MVP of the 2008-2009 season but Kobe wasn’t deserving in 2006? This is a bigger double standard than the one we have in Punjabi families.
                                        </p>

                                            Main argument I hear from people is that Wade is doing more with less and that’s not a bad argument but having Chalmers and Haslem/O’Neal starting as your PG & C is A LOT better than having Smush Paker and Kwame Brown.
                                          </p>

                                              And let’s not forget Kobe lead this sorry bunch of role players to the 7<sup>th</sup> seed in the WESTERN CONFERENCE. The 8<sup>th</sup> seeded team in West that year had a winning percentage of 537. Compare that to what Wade is doing this year. He’s lead an average team to the fifth seed in the Eastern conference and the 8<sup>th</sup> seeded team may not even hit 40wins and a sub 500 winning percentage. And let’s not forget the fact Kobe dropped 81 points in a game that season.
                                            </p>

                                              <p class="MsoNormal">
                                                If you put Wade in the Western Conference with the team that he has right now, no way he puts up the same numbers and no way his team has the same amount of wins. In the West you have to play the Spurs, Jazz, Hornets, Blazers & Rockets at least three times each and that means going up against better defenders such as Artest, Battier, Bowen and others. On the flip side, if you put Kobe’s 2006 team in the Eastern Conference that year he could’ve lead that team to home court advantage without a doubt in my mind.
                                              </p>

                                                  Again, D-Wade is an ill player whom I love to watch but please stop putting him ahead of LeBron and Kobe as a MVP candidate. I understand the fact his body broke down last year faster than Jonathon Bender’s knees but that doesn’t mean what he’s doing this year should be overly exaggerated. If you’re so god damn happy he’s doing this good after he was counted out, give him the Most Improved Player award (formerly known as the Comeback Player of the Year award), but stop saying he’s the MVP because he needs OT and a last second shot to beat a bad Chicago Bulls team at home. (Side Note: I was watching that game, he missed 2 shots and 3 free throws that could’ve clinched that game).

                                                          The way I see it, LeBron has to knock Kobe off his MVP status and so far this season, he hasn’t done that. The scoring averages and team records are exactly the same and LeBron averaging two more rebounds and assists per game. In their head to head matches, Kobes Lakers beat the Cavs both times, at home and on the road.

                                                            Furthermore, Kobe is a better all around player and knows exactly what his team needs. No one plays the game as good as Kobe right now, no one.
