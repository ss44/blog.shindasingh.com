Firstly Happy New year to anyone who wishes it, secondly Chuck Lidell = utter dominance.

There was no better way to end the year off&nbsp;, then watching UFC 66 with the Iceman going one on one again against the Huntington Beach Bad Boy. In all honesty I had to say that this card was right up there, and that's saying a lot considering it's coming off of the great PPV that happened only a month ago which saw Hughes get dethroned by the young legend in George St. Peirre. 

Anyway's here's a quick breakdown on how I saw things:

**_Jason MacDonald_ Vs. Chris Leben - [](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xw4nl_chris-leben-vs-jason-macdonald)&nbsp;**

I had MacDonald down to take this match early on and saw him dominating Leben right from the start. Leben none the less came in&nbsp;as a man on a mission, with that extra chip on shoulder ever since he got publicly man handled a few months back at the hands of Anderson Silva, showing us&nbsp;that he isn't near as bad as&nbsp;Silva made him out to be.&nbsp; After dominating MacDonalad most of the match, the Alberta native was able to catch Leben in the submission. To Lebens credit he held out and lost consciousness and the fight was stopped as a result. Although he's not the greatest of fighters in my book this kid clearly has heart.

**_Andrei Arlovski_ Vs. Marcio Cruz -** [](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xw6km_ufc66-arlovski-vs-cruz)

Arlovski is the man,&nbsp; the greatest heavyweight in the UFC today. Yea, Tim Sylvia has proven time and again why he's the champ, but 2006 was a tough year for Arlovski, but he ended it right by getting back to his winning ways.Although he didn't utterly dominate Cruz, he did beat him without breaking a sweat, which goes to show that not only&nbsp;is his conditioning set, but&nbsp;a&nbsp;fact that he deserves some real competition. Would love to see how he handles someone like Kamal's boy, Monson or how effectively he could deal someone like&nbsp;Vera 

**Forest Griffen Vs&nbsp;_Keith Jardine_** 

Griffen has risen ranks real fast, none the less he was handed what I would consider his first real loss in UFC thanks to Keith Jardine. Not much needs to be said about this fight other then Jardine hit Griffen where it hurt. Hopefully like Lebron, now that Griffen knows what it feels like to loose, hes going to come back harder then ever.

**_Chuck Liddell_ Vs. Tito Ortiz** 

The main event proved to be nothing short of what it was expected from Lidell. Ortiz came in with great poise while ol' Chukie boy came in with not a care in the world. Many questioned Lidell's drive and hunger compared to that of Tito's, none the less Lidell proved that being&nbsp;on top for&nbsp;so long&nbsp;hasn't taken anything away from his game.&nbsp;To Ortiz's credit he took the hits and covered up for as long as he could, but that saw him spending most of the fight in the fetal position while Chuck had his way. It was no secret that for Ortiz to win, the fight would need to taken to the ground, which is ironic considering Lidell's&nbsp;a wrestler first and only later&nbsp;became the striker he is today. All the same Ortiz&nbsp;had a few valiant attempts at taking Chuck down to ground in the second round, but just wasn't able to capitalize which saw Lidell holding on to the&nbsp;gold.

      <p>
        2007 seems to hold a lot of promise for UFC, thanks in part to 3 major fighters in the industry.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        1) Quinton Jackson. The only <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x68cu_chuck-liddell-vs-quinton-jackson">unresolved fight Lidell has on his plate</a>, Jackson should prove to be a welcome addition to the Light Heavyweight division. Whether or not he can repeat his victory on Lidell&nbsp;second time around should be interesting to watch. Personally I'd still put my money on Lidell seeing as how there last fight was almost a lifetime ago, and how both fighters have grown since. It will be interesting to see whether or not UFC has slown Lidell down any, and if K1 has really improved Jackson.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        2) Anderson Silva. It's only a matter of time (I hope) before him and GSP go toe to toe. I'd love to see Silva drop down or even GSP work 15 lbs up so that the two of these guys can&nbsp;go at it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        3) Mirco Cro Cop. Undoubtedly <em>one of</em> the greatest heavyweight in the world, its only a matter of time before he strips Tim Sylvia and then standing toe to toe against Arlovski. Although many in there sane minds don't see Arlovski having a chance, I think a fight like that is just what Arlovski needs to prove himself to the world.
