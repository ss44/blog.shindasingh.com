24 for the most part, well the first 4 seasons anyways, was probably one of the better shows on T.V. It's hard to think though that Jack would be able to pull the same shit if he didn't have Chloe, satellites or full access to every known encryption key ever created. All the same Jack was Jack way before high-speed modems existed as is seen from the original 94' 24 pilot.
