I was browsing through some randomness when I came across a piece of writing that I don't think was shared with the public. I agree with the following piece of writing that was written by none other than my main man Shinda Singh.

This was written before ShindaSingh.com thus that is why it was never made public. But fear not, the Sarpanch makes sure everything is viewable to the public.

Original Publish Date: **May 3rd - 2005**

This was written after Shinda watched Season 1 of **24.**

>       Yea I guess it's about time Shinda wrote something contraversial in this... Since I finished school I figured it was due time to catch up on 24. I started with Season 1, and within 2 days was able to complete it.

>       Theres so many things I can write on this show, but after season 1, the most evident point/ lesson made was that bibian are stupid..Now i'm not saying all bibian/girls are stupid but 97.89% are. 1% of em are tom boys and the others are prob smart.

>       But going back to the show,  bibian are stupid.......

>     <p>
>       Now definitlly I got people fuming as to how I'm making such comments, so the least I can do is substantiate these claims with proofs and examples from this season..
>     </p>

>       <strong>Jacks Daughter<br /> </strong>Now she was prob the stupidest female on this show. Being that I dont feel like writing out an essay here are some highlights of her stupidity...
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       - Sneaking out to be with guys...<br /> - Always trusting guys, giving them a chance (rick and his mans)...<br /> - The time she acted up against her moms...come on now attitude is so cliche..<br /> - Always sneaking about...<br /> - Going to Ricks house after for his help, (after the whole car fell of a cliff thing).<br /> - Going with the cops, back to CTU (after all she went through, you'd expect she'd want a helicopter or a tank escort)<br /> - I dont know, so many examples, so little time...
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       <strong>Jacks Wife<br /> </strong>Wouldn't classify her as a ditz, but she had her stupid moments...
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       - running around in circles looking for the water shed, (you got photographic image maps, therse no excuse for getting lost)<br /> - running around with the fake Yorke...Come on now, be smart...<br /> - parking on the edge of a cliff...<br /> - annoying everyone at CTU, just sit back and be patient....<br /> -  Booking Neena speaking german, and still trying to act cool with her?? Come on, somethings up, why pretend that if you act nice, she'll be nice??
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       Yea you can say she was acting wound up, and anyone would be, but come on now at least have some fortitude...but watever she still had some good qualities
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       - the phone con where she was able to steal the phone and hide it...<br /> - the way she was able to get rid of the assassin even though she parked on the cliff..
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       <strong>Presidents Wife</strong><br /> Now trying to explain this bibi is hard. you can argue that she's smart, but I saw her as just coniving, and weather you take that as a positive or negative trait is subjective, but I'll say she's a dumb ass..
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       - Hiding the truth? The truth can never be locked up!<br /> - Trying to get the assistant to seduce her husband so that she could have something against him later? Thats just low..<br /> - Destroying the tapes because you figure that would protect you from scandals..."bus aimee fudoo kum"
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       <strong>Presidents Assistant<br /> </strong>Yups just another dumb ass..
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       - Trying to seduce a married man?? Whats wrong with you??
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       <strong>That girl who stabbed the assasin<br /> </strong>- Why would you complicate things?? Damn girl keep your emotions in check...aimee PMS dee lugdee..Ended up complicating things...
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       <strong>The waitress bibi<br /> - </strong>She had to go and complicate things by baiting Jack out..What he ever do to you?? People these days...
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       <strong>Computer Bibi<br /> </strong>- running to the washroom to send out messages?? come on now thats kind of high schoolish no?<br /> <strong>Kali Cop<br /> </strong>- She got shot and murdered,  because of her stupidity, enough said..
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       This list is by no means complete. I could litterally re-watch the series and make a more indepth list of events and high light the many incompetencies of bibian displayed here, but I figure I made my point with the above...
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       Only bibi to not get mention is Neena...Cuz frankly she was smart, even though she was evil and a total sell out, she was still smart enough to handle her business..to bad she got caught, otherwise she'd been close to being flawless..
>     </p>
>     
>     <p>
>       Now by no means am I trying to say that all the guys where smart and perfect, since there where some complete dumb ass males also, but a majority of them still had styles and at least where not so blatently stupid as many of the girls.
>     </p>

>     <p>
>       Anyways anyone to work themselves up into a frit over the above is being stupid. If your a bibi and you take offense to the above, then you just go to prove the above statementl..It was just something that had to be said, your free to compile a list of stupid guys, but I doubt you'll get near as obvious examples...and please dont make comments in regards to the spelling/grammer. This was not an academic peice of writing it was more of a spur of the moment type of thing so no spell checker was used, and I didn't want to waste time reading this garbage so I refuse to proof-read it.
