As a follow up to the Fighting Videos I had to add this.

The video titled: Why would you fight someone like this, featured an upcoming Miami Street Fighter named Kimbo. (He's won the fight in the previous video.)

apparently Kimbo was on a hot streak he won mad fights, and that led to UFC fighter Sean Gannon accepting Kimbos call.

Enjoy,
