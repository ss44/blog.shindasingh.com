Last weekend [SikhSangat.com](http://www.sikhsangat.com) (popular Youth message board) was [hacked](http://www.sskhalsa.com/?p=98), and [Last weekend [SikhSangat.com](http://www.sikhsangat.com) (popular Youth message board) was [hacked](http://www.sskhalsa.com/?p=98), and](http://mistakesingh.blogspot.com/2006/05/popular-sikh-forum-down.html) (actually just a few blogs) were up in arms over this despicable act. After all _WHO_ would do such a thing? RSS, Congress, CSIS was the silent cry that resonated in the thoughts of few, after all who else would want to destroy SikhSangat.com?

From past experience anytime a Sikhi based website, especially one geared towards the Youth, has ever been hacked, the culprits themselves were Sikh Youth. The reason behind many of these hacks themselves consisted of personal squabbles where individuals had gotten into a fight of sorts with _the admin_.

The most famous and notorious of these so called hacks in my books was the whole SikhSangat and partners departing from [W!N](http://www.waheguroo.net), leaving W!N like Humpty Dumpty.That's not to say that change maybe wasn't needed and the whole split was probably and most likely for the best, but none the less, it wasn't exactly the most professional of breakups.

Anyways, after reading [this post](http://sikhproblems.blogspot.com/2006/05/sikhsangatcom-hacked_28.html), on a [Last weekend [SikhSangat.com](http://www.sikhsangat.com) (popular Youth message board) was [hacked](http://www.sskhalsa.com/?p=98), and [Last weekend [SikhSangat.com](http://www.sikhsangat.com) (popular Youth message board) was [hacked](http://www.sskhalsa.com/?p=98), and](http://mistakesingh.blogspot.com/2006/05/popular-sikh-forum-down.html) (actually just a few blogs) were up in arms over this despicable act.

Anyways, after reading [this post](http://sikhproblems.blogspot.com/2006/05/sikhsangatcom-hacked_28.html), on a](http://sikhproblems.blogspot.com/) that has become known for its thought provoking, in depth and inspiring articles, (hopefully that'll keep them from coming after me), I get the feeling that the SikhSangat hack wasn't all that much of a random act, and maybe, just maybe it was revenge. Then again that can't be confirmed, leaving it neither here nor there. I'm also more then confident that the W!N admin team, condemn such acts, after all they've been in similar shoes numerous times in the past.

Whats even more ironic though is that these websites (run by Youth) mimic the Gurdwara politics we see amongst the so called lost and confused elders. Just think about it; Group 1 and Group 2 all got sikhi parchaar as their ultimate goal. Group 2 feels Group 1 is not listening or cooperating and is pushing their own personal agenda so they book it and go off on there own, (of course only after trying incredibly hard to reconcile there differences, to no avail). Time goes by and Group 2 seems to be doing better, which off course takes the pisss with group 1, who now feels that group 2's movement is detrimental to their own, which off course is to do Sikhi Parchaar, and for that reason Group 2 is now the enemy, who should at no cost be spared. At the same time it would seem that all the new attention and "power" has gotten to Group 2 and as prophesied by many power corrupts. Group 1 wasting no time is all over the scandals. The corruption of Group 2 is brought out to the forefront, individuals are defamed and made to loose face, and then it all repeats.

So end of the day are we really all that different from past generations who we despise and credit for dropping the ball, since we've clearly already started down the same path? Is it fair to ridicule the so called elders in the Gurdwara committee's when in-fighting occurs, while we proudly boast that the new generation has a better grasp on things when clearly we don't. End of the day Internet sites only make up a small if not minuscule portion in the parchaar that is done, so if there's issues at such a low level of sikhi parchaar then what can one expect for the future?
