This used to be my yearly tradition over at PindGagan but now that I'm on ShindaSingh, I think it's only right to continue this tradition.

The NBA Playoffs start today at noon and it's about time I pleased the masses and shelled out NBA Picks. Now this year I'm doing it different as I'm only going to be posting the picks round by round. Y'all can post your picks as well and the person with the most correct picks will win some sort of cash prize.

**Winners in bold.**

**Western Conference**

**1 - LA Lakers** over Utah Jazz. 4-1.

**2 - Denver** over Hornets. 4-3.

**6 - Dallas** over Spurs. 4-3.

**5 - Houston** 0ver Portland. 4-3.

**Eastern Conference**

**1 - Cleveland** over Detroit. 4-2.

**7 - Chicago** over Boston. 4-3.

**3 - Orlando** over Philadelphia. 4-1.

**4 - Atlanta** over Miami. 4-2.

Ite those are mine, get your in as soon as you can.
