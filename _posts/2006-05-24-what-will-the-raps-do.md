Ironically in a twist of fate the Raptors secure the #1 spot, and overcame the 8.8 % shot they had at getting it. What this means for Raptors fans is simple, a brighter future. Giving Colangelo the first round draft pick, is in many ways like giving Jordan the ball with 2 seconds left in a game 7 of the NBA finals, you know he's going to make magic.

Now with that said what will Colangelo do? No doubt, it'll be the best thing for the franchise, but what exactly does he have in store?

Here is where I submit the following few options as I see them to date.

Firstly the Raptors are in the market for a few new things:

1) A new PG. We have no choice but to rid ourselves of the arrogant, narcissistic Mike James. This is a guy, who no one even knew about until he was on the Raptors. Sure he has a play off ring, but its fair to say that he never won anything on his own, or helped Detroit win it. But more importantly then all of that, there is a more important reason why Mike James has to go,"He just doesn't fit in" - Martha Stewart. He's not Colangelo's type of of PG, hes a shoot first, pass later type of a guy, and that's just not acceptable in Raptors land with the new sheriff and all.

2) A Center. The raptors are shaping up to have one of the best front courts in the league. Bosh and Villanueva have shown that they are true all stars, both having there 40 + nights. Even so, neither of them are true centers, and for that reason alone a center is something we could use. Imagine Bosh and Villie at Forwards, then give them a decent low man and bam, things are going good.

Now with that said it will be interesting to see which way the Raptors lean. A name that seems to be coming up everywhere with the #1 pick and all is Bosh's boy, Aldridge. However Colangelo dismissed these rumors saying that he doesn't see Aldridge shaping up into a top a center of the likes of Shaq or Amare, and with Bosh and Villie V in the back court he doesn't see that much of a need for him.

Bosh made it clear that he doesn't see the need for another finesse style big man on the team and feels that what the Raptors really need is a good pg who "passes us the ball", and a pg who "makes the open the shots". I find it safe to say that Bosh is as sick of James as I am.

Seeing as to how Bosh agrees with me, I think its safe to say that the Raptors will be getting a new PG in this off season so, so long Mike James, who? exactly.. I can't say who we'll be getting in his place since I'm not in tune with the market so I'll leave that to the Real GM's here to speculate.

Colangelo has made it more the obvious and clear that he intends to bring Andrea Bargani here, and I doubt he'd waste the #1 pick. What I see happening more or less is him giving up the first round pick for a possible 5th, 6th. Getting rid of Mike James (how he does it I don't really care as long as he gets rid of him). I can see Alvin Williams retiring, opening up some more space, thus giving the Raptors more options.

In result the Raptors have a 'bang em low', front court in Bosh and Villie V in addition to a pg who can get them the ball. They also got the 3 pt line up in Peterson, Bargani, Villie V, and the new PG.

As far as Bosh being the future, I see Colangelo wanting to focus the team more around Bargani in the future more then around Bosh.(Just by the way he bigs up Bargani already)

But then again maybe Colangelo is just Machiavellian in his ways. Bigging up Bargani selling the idea to other GM's and positioning himself to make some quick grabs while everyone else has their eyes are on the next big thing.

Anyways here's a video of Bragani I found on google video so now to leave y'all to it.
