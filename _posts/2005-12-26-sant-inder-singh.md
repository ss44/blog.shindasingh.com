</div></a>I found the above image on [SikhSangat](http://www.sikhsangat.com/), its a photograph of Sant Inder Singh Bhindranwale. Sant Inder Singh was the brother of Sant Baba Sunder Sigh Ji and both got sikhiya from Sant Baba Bishan Singh.A new trend or argument that's been developing is that the Damdami Taksal of today, does not have the unbroken lineage as Taksal itself promotes, and that the Taksal of today really only started from Sant Baba Sundar Singh Ji, and has no links to Shaheed Baba Deep Singh Ji.There are variations of the above argument with some insisting that the Taksal of today was started by Sant Baba Kartaar Singh, with the "real" Taksal being that of Giani Mohan Singh. While others claim that the real Damdami Taksal ended its lineage after Shaheed Baba Gurbaksh Singh, and that the Taksal of today really only materialized in the 70's under Sant Kartaar Singh.The nature of many of these arguments is usually to belittle or discredit Taksal in some shape or manor. Basically a shot to say that Taksal has little or no legitimacy in Panthic affairs based on the fact that its not near as old as it makes itself out to be.However regardless of when you take Taksal as being started, nothing can change the contributions made by the Taksal for the sake and uplifting of the Panth, or the kurbanian made by those Gurmukhs who have acted as the heads of the seminary from whenever you choose to date its beginnings.Its arguments, such as the one about Sant Sundar Singh Ji starting Taksal, which baffle me. Individuals talk about having conflicting historical reports, but what about the fact that both Sant Sunder Singh Ji and Sant Inder Singh Ji had stayed and studied with Sant Baba Bishan Singh, and both wrote about the time they spent within the Jatha with Sant Bishan Singh Ji, does this not come to mean anything?Sall good, shouldn't waste to much time dwelling over this, since I'm not out here to change what people think about Taksal, as regardless of what people think, the duty / mission statement of Taksal will remain the same.[<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Jernail_23-723873.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Jernail_23-749047.jpg)Back to Sant Inder Singh, I remember hearing about them before in Katha a little bit, but that was ages ago. Hopefully I can keep a look out for some more info, and once I find that share it here. Its interesting to see that in the above picture Sant Inder Singh seems fairly old (thick white dhara and all), but they are relatively young in comparison to the image they have with Sant Jarnail Singh that was taken late 1970's early 80's .Chullo that's enough for today, need to really work at saying more, in less words, otherwise I'mma end up being as verbose as Marcus from the last Apprentice (Trump).
