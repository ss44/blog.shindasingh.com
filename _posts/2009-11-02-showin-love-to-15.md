Ever since Vince Carter was traded in December 2004 he has been hated by the Raptor faithful. First it was hate for the fact he wanted out of Toronto. Then because of what we got for him. Then it was because he said he didn't give it his all while he was in Toronto. Then it was because of how he learned to play injury free in New Jersey. Then it was because he beat us in the playoffs. And in the end, like he said, we hated him because we missed him.

That's all it really was because deep in our hearts we know if he stayed and let Bosh develop, we would've been title contenders. Deep down we missed his explosive dunks. Deep down we missed seeing our Raptor on every highlight reel in the world. Deep down we missed raising our hands in the air and going "Brup, Brup" every time we saw him climb a 7'2 ladder with ease. And to show him how much we missed him, how much we loved him, we booed him.

Because let's face it, if it wasn't Vince Carter basketball in Toronto would've died. We would've folded and moved down south like our brethrens in the West with the Vancouver Grizzlies. As much as I hated Vince during the past five years, even I knew deep down that without him I wouldn't have a place to go to and jump around so in the end we owe him a "Thank You." Thank you for putting Toronto on the map.

The reason I bring up memories of our favourite hero and villain is because the Raptors may end up honouring Vince Carter on November 22nd as a part of the Raptors 15th anniversary celebration. Check out the following link:

I personally welcome this. It's been long enough since he left the T-Dot and this is due. Carter still loves the city as he has always said and this is the place he grew up and became a man. Yes... a man! I also think that after he retires Raptors need to retire his #15 and raise it to the rafters in the ACC because the man who built the ACC and took over this country needs to fly forever.
