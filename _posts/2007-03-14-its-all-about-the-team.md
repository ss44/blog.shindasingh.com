or in case of the Green Street Hooligans, the firm. So yesterday I came across this movie, Green Street hooligans, never heard of it before, never even knew it existed until someone recommended I check it out. Now usually when a movie goes un-noticed its&nbsp;because the movie sucks, or it's in some next language and you have to read&nbsp;subtitles to make sense of things, this movies neither of the two. 

I won't go into details, but this has to be one of the greatest sports movies of all time. Then again that could be because it has little to do with sports and more about the firms that surround the English football scene. See there's never been a question that the Europeans take&nbsp;sports seriously, and that Football is like religion down there with the star players being like prophets, but who would have guessed that the sports teams&nbsp; got&nbsp;a gang type sub culture. Groups willing to go to war with other groups all based on&nbsp;the home teams. Imagine being a part of a crew, and whenever the Raps played New Jersey you'd all go down together to start it up with the New Jersey crew, who&nbsp;are&nbsp;affiliated with the Nets.&nbsp;It would take the Carter beef to a whole&nbsp;'nother level. &nbsp;

Now whether such things as firms even exist is beyond me, I wouldn't be surprised if they do and maybe the UK natives could confirm that, but&nbsp;regardless they go to make one hell of a movie. To best describe this movie its a Fight Club meets some soccer flick, meets Boyz in the Hood. I'm telling you this movies an instant classic, on all levels. For some reason though I couldn't get 300 out of my head, "This is Madness...NOOO this is GREEEEEEEEEEN STREEEEEEEET"....

Whatever check the trailer out and be sure to grab the movie, its on [mininova](http://www.mininova.org/tor/241092) still,&nbsp;that is off course if you can't find it at Blockbuster or anywhere else.
