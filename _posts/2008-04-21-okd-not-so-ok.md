I wouldn't have been surprised if I read this about Malton, or even New Rexdale, but I have to say that the fact it was Dixie that got its charitable status stripped did come as bit of a surprise. A while back [I posted](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2006/02/04/gurdwara-finances/) wondering where the funds were going, but I was getting the vibe that the new committee had really taken up office and really started to clean things up. Also considering Dixie's political muscle at both Federal and Provincial levels you would think that they'd be the most immune and well protected when shit hit the proverbial fan.

All the same, when the Feds come a knocking it seems that the biggest are the first to get noticed. I wouldn't be surprised if this is in result to the Conservatives politicking over the whole [anti Khalistan up-risal](http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=edd257ba-cc42-420e-bacf-fa36cc1f4959) that's been front and center in the usual papers, merly using this as an opportunity to force the Liberals gambit by either having them stand with the _alleged terrorists_, or distancing themselves from the community when they know they'll be looking for support the most. Either way the Liberals won't be getting out of this one looking like the heroes that they had been in the past.

Also knowing our community, and knowing the political struggle thats been taking place at Dixie for the last little while, this may very well have been a calculated attack at the Guru Ghar and by proxy its current committee by even more internal and nefarious members in an attempt to strike there blow, when they could. Wouldn't put it past someone to start snitching to the Feds second they got there hands on some accounting. I'm all for accountability within our Guru Ghars, but it needs to come from within and not from without.

Should be interesting to see what happens next, and what cards are played by whom. Especially with the Downtown Nagar Kirtan (a time when Dixie would usually get large donations from Sangat) being only a few days away.
