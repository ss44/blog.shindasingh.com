With that&nbsp; known I was kind of surprised to find this as being at the home page as there featured article of the day: [Sikhism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism). 

Millions of people log onto Wikipedia daily, so that means potentially a million people have read that article.&nbsp; 

One small step for man, one giant leap for the Sikh kind .... or is it?
