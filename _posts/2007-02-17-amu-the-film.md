Even though most of you have your attention and sights set on All Star Weekend, I thought it would be safe to share some info about some other happenings, specifically Amu, a movie that looks at the whole 1984 Riots in Delhi. 

I haven't seen the movie myself, but will probably try and make it sometime to check it out soon, just because it does seem promising. By promising I mean that it does seem to have some potential to educate if not give some insight into just a part of what happened in 1984. I remember few years back there was Hawyian, but that movie no where near lived up to the hype surrounding it, and instead felt more like a SSA/COSS meeting that was aimed at tackling a problem, but instead settled everything by pulling the whole "mis-communication" line.

Hopefully Amu will be different. Hopefully it will take a solid stand and not really sit on the fence as much as I feel Hawyian did. From what I've been told by those who have watched it, the movie is worth watching and supporting, so&nbsp;I'll give&nbsp;it&nbsp;a chance and see what happens.

  I'll probably follow up with a review of it if I do get a chance to check it out, which I do hope is pretty soon. For those interested, below is the official trailer with the synopsis from the site and local show times. The organizers are hoping to get enough people out this weekend to help fuel this movie's play time at the given theaters since it is limited and&nbsp;the theaters intent on keeping the movie running is motivated almost entirely by ticket sales.

    <strong>Summary:</strong>
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Amu is the journey of Kajori Roy, a 21-year-old Indian American woman who has lived in the US since the age of 3. After graduating from UCLA Kaju goes to India to visit her relatives. There she meets Kabir, a college student from an upper class family who is disdainful of Kaju’s wide-eyed wonder at discovering the “real India”. Undeterred Kaju visits the slums, crowded markets and roadside cafes of Delhi. In one slum she is struck by an odd feeling of déjà vu. Soon after she starts having nightmares. Kabir gets drawn into the mystery of why this is happening particularly when he discovers that she is adopted.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Meanwhile Kaju’s adoptive mother – Keya Roy, a single parent and civil rights activist in LA, arrives unannounced in Delhi. She is shocked to discover that Kaju has been visiting the slums. Although Kaju mistakes her mother’s response to a typical Indian over protectiveness – Keya’s fears are deeper rooted. 
      
      <p>
        Slowly Kaju starts piecing together what happened to her birth parents and mother and daughter clash as Kaju discovers she has been lied to her whole life. What was the truth? Why was it suppressed? As Kaju and Kabir undertake this quest they both discover their families involvement with a man made tragedy of immense proportions which took place twenty years ago in the capital city of India: the massacre of thousands of people of the Sikh faith. In a searing climax the young people are forced to confront the reality of the past and how it affects the present.
