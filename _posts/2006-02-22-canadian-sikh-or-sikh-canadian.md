I was having a discussion with a Singh about comments he left, in an [article](http://thepanthicotpreka.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-are-sikhs-being-spit-on.html) on [The Panthic Otpreka](http://thepanthicotpreka.blogspot.com/), in which he raised an interesting conversation point:Are we Canadian Sikhs or Sikh Canadians? Now for many this may seem like something pretty redundant and petty, but are we Canadians then Sikh? Or are we Sikhs then Canadian?

I would like to think the latter. Although we make home in Canada; a Sikhs first and foremost allegiance should be too their Guru, but I agree that this is just making note of a grammatical nuisance considering by no means does being a _tall Sikh_ or a _fast Sikh_ make one less of a of Sikh rather describes a characteristic of that Sikh.

However, regardless of how we formulate the sentence the real discussion revolves around the intent behind it. Do we intend to say that we are Canadians who happen to be Sikh? Or Sikhs who happen to be Canadian? Although both can be said using either line, the meanings for each is quite different. Whereas one implies loyalties to Guru Gobind Singh and the Panth first the other implies loyalties to the host nation first then after to the Guru and the Panth.

So where am I going with this. As Sikhs we need to realize that we have our own nation. Guru Sahib made and created us as Nyara, and not just in looks and philosophies as they apply in the religious sense, rather Nyara in the independent sovereign nation sense.

  * We have our own distinct identity and dress. (Panj Kakaars, Bana etc).
  * Own language, with its own dialect (Singha dee boli, atey Singhaa de Bol Balay)
  * Own musical traditions (Gurmat Sangeet - Partaal)
  * Both a political and pseudo religious system (Punj Pyarai & hierarchy of a justice system, Takhats).
  * Etc.

(A great read alluding to this can be read on [solariders](http://solarider.org/blog/) blog Â– [The Revolutionary Sikh Spirit](http://solarider.org/blog/?p=692))

They are not subservient to anyone, They are either purely sovereign or in a state of rebellion

To these Sikhs I have blessed sovereignty; They shall never forget their prophet,

I think the above just speaks for itself, we are either free, or we are fighting for that freedom, there is no middle ground, which brings things back to what caused this whole conversation in the first place, the Sikhs and the Kirpaan.

With the Supreme Court decision coming out anytime now, there is no accepting a verdict that bans or puts unacceptable limits on the Kirpaan or any other kakaar for that matter. After all that would go against the fact that we have already establishished we are soverign.

So where is this all going and what does this all mean? Well it means that we need to identiy who we are. Unlike what many like Mr T Sher Singh have said,

> "With the utmost respect, Mr. Vedanti and the Akhal Takht have no understanding of the Canadian context on this issue and have no jurisdiction to tell Canadians how to deal with it," T. Sher Singh, a Guelph lawyer and trustee of the Sikh Foundation International, said.
> 
> "He's no more a priest or high priest than I am the Queen of England," Singh added. He noted that Sikhdom does not have a religious hierarchy.

Sri Akaal Takht Sahib has every right to dictate to Sikhs abroad especially those who have pledgded there allegance to the Guru Panth (by receiving Amrit), how to behave and act, after all any less would be us moving away even further from the system established by Guru Sahiban themselves.

So think, are you a Canadian first or a Sikh?
