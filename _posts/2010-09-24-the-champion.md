Over the years I've gotten some very funny stories about people driving and doing stupid things with their cars and this one has to be one of the funniest and stupidest.

A friend of mine recently bought a new car and his sister took it out and on her way back she realized the car needed fuel. So like any other individual (or most), she stopped at the gas station to fill up and it just so happened there was a huge line at the gas station. Being the impatient person she is and thinking she's smarter than everyone else she saw an empty pump and drove on over. She proceeded to fill it up so she can drive home. After she filled it up, and luckily before starting the car, she realized she had put diesel in her car. That's righ, Diesel. Even though it says DIESEL everywhere on the pump, she still put it in. At this point she still wasn't sure if what she was doing was wrong so thankfully she asked a few people and realized she done F'd up.

The best part of this story comes afterwards. My friend asked her how she ended up putting diesel in it.

Her answer: "There was such a longggg line at the other pumps and this pump was empty."

Honestly, I don't even know what to say. After he told me that I couldn't help but just laugh at it. "The pump was empty."

Wow.
