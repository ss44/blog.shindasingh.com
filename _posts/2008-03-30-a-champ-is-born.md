With the NCAA tourney going on and everything else happening, I don't know how many folks managed to catch last nights Strikeforce Fight event which featured Cung Le vs "The Legend" Frank Shamrock, but those who missed it, really missed out.

Being a fan of Frank ever since his old Lions Den,championship days I couldn't help but wanting a part of me to see him win. At the same time Cung Le had champion written all over him, and although not having watched him fight on many of his previous occasions looking him up and catching his highlights showed that this man is destined to be a future hall of famer, and he didn't disappoint last night.

For those who missed out, I scoured the net and here's a copy of the fight, as usual I don't expect this video to remain live for to long, so if its dead just search for it in the all usual places:

Although Cung Le's still pretty green and still has ways to go before he'll be considered a member of the elite and be considered a challenge for the likes of Anderson Silva, his victory over Frank, (even if it came at Franks own expense of keeping the fight off of the ground), is a great start for any future champ.
