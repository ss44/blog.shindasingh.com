  For those of you from the GTA it's more than likely that you already know about Khalsa Pizza's grand opening <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this Saturday</span> <strong>June 28th</strong>. Like myself, you may have possibly found a flyer on your windshield after a Nagar Kirtan, a wedding or some other program. Maybe you even went to the Kirtan program last weekend that was held at the location. All the same, regardless of how you may have known about it, take this as just a reminder that the grand opening is this weekend and to go check it out. Not being a fan of Popular, Pizza Depot, or Moga's, I do welcome a new challenger into the mix.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Saturday</span> <strong>June 28th</strong>, while watching <a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2008/05/24/hockey-night-in-brampton/">Hockey Night in Canada in Punjabi</a>, or as you sit back and catch the possible game between the Lakers and Spurs, or even if you choose to catch the premiere of Saturday Night Fights on CBS, (where Kimbo will viciously rip through another spoon fed opponent), be sure keep Khalsa Pizza in mind for all your feasting needs.
