The Federal election is less then 72 hours away, and the polls got the Conservatives well ahead of the competition, hinting at what could be a Conservative majority.

Now, everyone has their reasons to vote the way they do, but one thing I was thinking about was, how the selection of the next government affects Sikhs, primarily our right to wear the Kirpan.

[<img width="142" height="304" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/kirpaan-722517.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/kirpaan-727355.jpg)Right now the whole Kirpan issue is in the Supreme Court, and the people down their, are trying to figure out what do with the whole mess. Basically if the Supreme Court comes out with a negative verdict then we're pretty much faded, as it sets the pretense for all other cases involving the Kirpaan throughout Canada. i.e. we can potentially see school boards, work places, and other institutions, putting restrictions on the Kirpaan or banning it all together.

Now if this happens, the only other way to over rule the courts decision would be to introduce legislation that counters the courts decision, and this is where the Government in power comes to matter.

Just by nature, and due to who the Conservatives largely represent (for the most part, right wing hicks), I can't seem to picture any sort of Kirpaan legislation passing under their watch. Whereas with the Liberals, not only do we have Amritdhari MP's, we have many other MP's who rely heavily on the Sikh vote, and support, and so by virtue of politics, would end up supporting and helping pass such legislation. I can also see the NDP supporting such legislation just out of their party's rhetoric and their right wing stance on freedoms.

Of course none of this will matter, if the Supreme Court rules in favour of the whole Kirpan situation, but I still think it is something to think about when it comes time to cast our ballots.
