**Disclaimer:** The following post was submitted to ShindaSingh.com by anonymous source. This person apparently doesn't have the testicular fortitude to put his name with the following piece of writing. All I gotta say is grow some balls and put your name down next time. This site is surrounded by a bunch of WNBA players.

  A couple of months ago during a casual conversation with Shinda, he mentioned that I write a post or two on the blog. I like to think it is because Shinda realized most people drool their shit and that I can spit with the best of them, but in all likelihood he didn’t think I was anything special and simply needed someone to keep this baby a float. Because let’s face it, this site was drowning faster than an unsupervised 3 year old jumping into the deep end.<span> </span>

  I simply couldn’t think of any topic that was interesting enough to write about, so the thought quickly faded. I could have went negative, and we all know that would have drawn hits faster than a dodra bibi can do her eyebrows ( see, this comment alone will likely incite mass hysteria and somehow PETA will be showing up at my door to throw red paint on my face).<span> </span>But recently I realized we have A LOT to be thankful for, and a positive post was in order.<span> </span>
</p>

  So let’s start with the positives Sikhi wise. The Malton Nagar Kirtan went along smoothly, and it’s always fun to see everyone together. The 1 million chaupai sahibs was surpassed, and the panth is probably better because of it.<span> </span>International Yudh was a ‘great success’ and actually surprised me with the amount of sangat that came out and stayed for the duration in Jersey.<span> </span>T.O lost to BC in the final, so I guess the stars were lining up and everything was actually right in this world.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  And finally, yesterday it became clear that Toronto has the two best General Managers in their respective sports.<span> </span>I simply cannot stop staring at the rosters of both the Raps and the Leafs, I just stare and stare with no regard as to who is watching me. I feel like a ref at LA fitness.<span> </span>The magic that BC and BB pulled to transform these teams is almost beyond words.<span> </span>

  Brian Burke cemented the transformation of the Blue and White with the signing of Phil Kessel. Phil ‘one ball’ Kessel is the real deal. The one ball is in reference to the fact that he only has one ball, after his bout with testicular cancer. (On a side note, having one ball probably makes him half as more focused on hockey, and maybe even more aero dynamic. If it was up to me all Toronto athletes would have vasectomies, and their balls handed back to them at the end of the parade route after we win a championship.)<span> </span>While the stock was high for Kessel, and 2 firsts is a steep price, the fact that the leafs have stockpiled on young players through the U.S collegiate level and overseas, it was a move that was made a lot easier.<span> </span>With 36 goals in 70 games at the age of 21, Kessel could easily hit 50 in a few years, and realizing this was his shot at a bonafied sniper Burkie got’er done.

#### Every T.O fan recalls the feeling of despair just a couple months ago. It was a feeling of more losing seasons ahead and contemplating on why our parents immigrated here when we could be cheering for a successful Indian cricket team. <span></span>But as a direct result of two men this has all changed, and I’m now more excited than a teeny bopper waiting for the next twilight book. One issue that has come up is how appropriate it would be for a Singh to have “Kadri” on the back of a jersey, but with the plethora of jerseys now available I don’t think anyone will have that problem.
