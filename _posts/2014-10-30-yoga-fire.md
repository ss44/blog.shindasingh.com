Fightland feature on Jonathan Brookins describing his rise, demise and return.

> "When I was in India, I would spend $2 a day somedays for a concrete slab and a blanket, and I would live in this place for a month no shower, only thing outside was a bucket and I was like "man, why am I so happy?". Because you know you didn't have the pressures of the Western world and no TV telling you that this is wrong. But you'd go outside and feel the energy of the day and be so exhilarated.
