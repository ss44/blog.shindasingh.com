Firstly I apologize to those who've been&nbsp;looking for a post, for not having had one sooner, but&nbsp;truthfully there's nothing _new_ for me to add that isn't already&nbsp;known or hasn't already been published&nbsp;by more credible sources, and like everyone else&nbsp;look to these sources for any new bit of information they can pass our way.

<a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/TheDera..TheBaba.ThePost_FC7B/3288_jameinsa%5B3%5D.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 10px; border-right-width: 0px" height="139" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/TheDera..TheBaba.ThePost_FC7B/3288_jameinsa_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg" width="184" align="right" border="0" /></a> The controversy for those not aware in a nut shell is the leader of Dera Sacha Sauda, who's name really deserves no promotion, thought he was a bad ass,&nbsp;went out and tried to create his own institution of Amrit, but instead of blessing the world with&nbsp;nectar of the iron blade, he instead got prissy and gave us a big bowl of pink milk [not that there's anything wrong with rufza, but saying you got baptized by it,&nbsp;is just weak]. Anyway's the Baba went on to initiate what he called sat-sitaray, and after administering the pink milk to his followers knelt in front of them and asked they initiate him with the sticky pink stuff also. 

Once that image and news hit the desi papers, all hell started [as it should] broke loose and Sangat'an&nbsp;gathered in Bhatinda to protest, and protest they did burning effigies and all. If this Baba was running it small time like Mann Chand or whoever else this would have been it the end of it, but&nbsp;seeing as how this Dera has thousands of followers those mans decided to crash the Protest attacking those protesting and also causing a scene. Now lets face it, after 1978 and 1984 the panth has had this&nbsp;flame in the pit of its gut just looking for a spark to come out, a means to lash out and the Baba's chelay crashing the protest and showing that they were ready to go toe to toe is what ignited that flame.

So now you had riots in Bhatinda, The Panth&nbsp;vs the&nbsp;Dera and its chelay. Well that's what it looks&nbsp;like on the outside if off course&nbsp;there wasn't&nbsp;the political undertone which also exists at bottom of this which features the legendary bout between Congress&nbsp;and the Akali's. <a href="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/TheDera..TheBaba.ThePost_FC7B/Badals_SachaSauda%5B3%5D.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 10px; border-right-width: 0px" height="134" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/WindowsLiveWriter/TheDera..TheBaba.ThePost_FC7B/Badals_SachaSauda_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg" width="220" align="right" border="0" /></a> 

See Badal knew that the Dera had clout amongst the masses and it's why he made it a pit stop&nbsp;in his campaign for votes, but unlike the small time Babay that he has under his wing the Dera wanted what Badal couldn't deliver and there&nbsp;go threw its support behind the Congress party.&nbsp;Which in turn gives this situation a political overtone that could clearly well overshadow the phantic matter at hand, albeit 1978 and 84 were riddled with political overtones which are used to discredit&nbsp;the movement all the time. 

Since Monday (when the first protests happened), protests have sparked up all over the once thriving state of Punjab, and it would seem as though that Sikhs have felt the bigger of the blows in terms of negative media coverage and causalities, all the same the fight continues.

&nbsp;What has me confused is if Badal and the Akali's, are the ones who started this [supposedly], then why is Badal posturing for the Jatehdars he has under his thumb to hold off from bringing about a sandesh or Hukamnamaa (Badal reportedly asked them to hold for a week), after all wouldn't it be in _his_ best interest?&nbsp;None the less, Singh Sahib Vedanti today issused a hukamanama stating a full out boycott against the Dera all the same.

Most Singh's I know and have spoken to, are riling at the news and many are on the edge of their seats with a cross between eager and nervous&nbsp;anxiousness, hoping that this is just what the Panth needed and what will once and for all bring us right back to where we left off in the mid 80's, but I guess that will be left up to how our leaders and the government react to&nbsp;the incident. Although how many&nbsp;have actually gone out and bought tickets to India to join in the struggle is yet to be seen, but whether this in fact sparks a re-emergence of the struggle is also yet to be seen.

As far as what I expect to come out of all this, my guess is as good as the next man's. Whether this finally brings about a time when all those of us&nbsp;who once talked about giving Shaheedi a chance to actually live up to our words or&nbsp;on the flip side&nbsp;coward behind them is to soon to be known. After all this whole thing could just shrivel up into being just an isolated incident that _could have_ put India back into a civil war, but didn't. But seeing as how this has led to a few Kurbani and injuries already, I doubt that this will be just another foot note in our history.

So lets see what happens and hope that the Himmat is still there.
