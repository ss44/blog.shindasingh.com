Looks like the Ottawa guys[[1](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=239), [2](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=73)] got some competition when it comes to making hit videos, since the mans from Guelph aren't all that far behind.
  
All right, fair enough it's not the greatest video out there but all attempts are worth some praise.

The jokes, well you can only hear Russell Peters, "someones gonna get hurt real bad" line so many times, before it gets played out, and fair enough the stereotypes and accents were a bit overboard. All the same the video got 1st place in the <span style="display: inline" id="vidDescRemain">John F. Ross Film Festival</span>, so that has to be worth something towards the movies credit, and is a good step forward for everyone in the community, and will hopefully inspire these mans into making some better films, down the road.
  
What more is there to say other then Kashmiri Singhs are on the verge of doing big things....
