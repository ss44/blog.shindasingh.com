[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1129" title="tebow" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tebow.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tebow.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tebow-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tebow.jpg)

Not that long ago Sarpanch Sahib admitted he was not on the Tebow bandwagon and at that time I couldn't have agreed with him more. I've been hating on Tebow this entire season, right from his inception miracle in Miami. (Actually I won't lie I was rooting for Denver that game, but after that I was all on the hate Tebow bandwagon).  The fact that he got to the playoffs despite my throwing of stones at him didn't exactly help.

Luckily I thought Big Ben, the antithesis of everything Tebow was would quickly bring an end to this era of Tebow mania. It would be like the '96 Bash at the Beach, and Big Ben would be the one to deliver the <a title="Hogan Bash At the Beach" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO9zxsRzN-M" target="_blank">Hollywood Leg Drop</a> that would crush the hopes and dreams of everyone in Denver that day.

Alas none of it played out the way it should have, or at least the way that I had hoped. Instead Tebow went on to play his best game. A game that left us, some of his greatest critics, who like the Romans had been pelting him with stones only earlier, to be silenced and left on our knees asking for forgiveness.

In colliminating his prophecy even further Tebow went on to the throw for the biblical 316 yards,

> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." - John 3:16

Now like a month ago Tebow faces off  against an even truer test, one in which even the heavens in all there glory may not be able to help him, going up against the golden lock's of Tom Brady. Yet Tebows legend needs no Superbowl finish. He needs not continue to prove himself, for his haters have been silenced, and at the end of the day, "haters gonnna hate". But in that vain there will be one less hater hating from the sidelines.

That being said, lets go Pats.
