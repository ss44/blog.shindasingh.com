For the last week, Mann Sion's chelay helped resonate there thoughts on this blog with the usual, "there is no proof, has been no proof and never will be any proof" type cries. Unfortunately for them the proof is in the pudding. I know a lot of you are getting bored, considering Mann Sion's guilt was established a few years back, and all this harping is pointless. However just as a side note entry I present to you the following, all copped from [Panthic Weekly](http://www.panthic.org/) (without permission)

Exhibit 1: Rara Sahib Says Beware of Sadh Mann Sion (click to enlarge)

Exhibit 2: [Panthic Jathedar Singh Sahib Ranjit Singh finally speaks out.](http://www.panthic.org/news/125/ARTICLE/2619/2006-07-09.htmlhttp://www.panthic.org/news/125/ARTICLE/2619/2006-07-09.html)

Exhibit 3: [Letters from Congressman and various Sikh Gurdwara's/organizations banning Mann singh](http://www.panthic.org/news/123/ARTICLE/2616/2006-07-09.html)

Exhibit 4:Video of Mann Sion Acting like he's a Guru

Exhibit 5: [Images of Protest](http://www.panthic.org/gallery.php?id=2614) (Mann Sion's chelay went running to the cops and still got faded)

Exhibit 6: Mann Sion legal Name? Sant Mann Singh!?!?

What type of guy actually goes and makes his name Sant Mann Singh?. Come on now, no real Sant tells people I'm a sant worship me. Sallaaa..

Anyways I figure thats enough for now. Undoubtedly more will be coming out in the near future so keep ya eyes posted to [Panthic Weekly](http://www.panthic.org/) for more and I'll see what I can do to keep yall posted.

End of the day, the proof is in the pudding.
