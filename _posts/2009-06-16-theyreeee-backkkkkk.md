Who might you say is back? We all know them. We see them on a daily basis. We curse at them on a daily basis. Yes, yes. It's the one and only... the bad drivers of the world. Also known as female drivers.

> <!-- ARTICLE CONTENT -->More than just the price at the pumps proved painful for a woman who mistakenly hit the gas instead of the brake and smashed up a gas station in Scarborough early this morning.
> 
> Toronto police say that shortly after midnight a 43-year-old woman was pulling into a Shell station near Brimley Rd. and Finch Ave. E., when she accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the brake.
> 
> Her Toyota Highlander veered to the left and struck a blue Dodge Caravan and a nearby garbage can damaging two gas pumps at the station, said Sgt. Carl Heilimo. The car then crashed into the front sliding doors of the convenience store at the station.
> 
> An attendant said this morning the collision had cleared, and the station and the pumps was operating as normal, save for a few damaged shelves and vending machines inside the store.
> 
> No injuries were reported.
