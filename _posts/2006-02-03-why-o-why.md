If you have ever wanted to learn the meaning of the word patience, then I suggest you become a Raptor fan.

Ever since 1996, thats exactly what they've been testing from all their loyal fans, it's for that reason that it's not surprising that the last game against Sacremento, had the the lowest turn out.

Now its no surprise that Jalens gone, after all he's always been at the heart of all trade rumors, that ever exisited thanks in large part to his huge contract, so its not really alll that surprising that he's gone, but the fact that the Raptors would give up a first round draft pick in addition to Rose for an ex all star who wanted out of the city to begin with, is somewhat perplexing.

For starters I really dont think we need a big man on the team. Bosh and Villuenava seem to have things covered down low. So although Davis is an asset I dont really see him being that big of a factor.

Secondly the teams in rebuild mode. We need our draft picks, not only do they act as good bargining chips, they also give us the chance to pick up another strong rookie.

Lastly I honestly think if we where going for a mature player then we should have rested on trying to sign a shooting guard, to play alongside Mike James, who? MIKE JAAAAAAAMES.

Ah well, can't judge an artists work until its done. Hopefully their will be some more trades in the near future (this summer) that can help restore some faith in this team.
