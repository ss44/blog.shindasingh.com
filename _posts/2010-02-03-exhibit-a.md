A while back there was a lot of chatter on this blog about men and more specifically, women drivers. Here's some proof to add more gas to that fire.

>       As news goes, its about as earth-shattering as declaring that the Pope is Catholic or that theres an excess of saltwater in the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, a new study has revealed that women are worse at parking than men. (In case anyone thinks the fix is in, the scientist in charge of the study is female.)

>       The details: not only do women drivers typically take an average of 20 seconds longer to park their cars, but they still manage to do a poor job as theyre less likely to end up in the middle of the parking space compared to their male counterparts.

>       As part of a test, 65 drivers were asked to park an Audi A6 sedan in a standard-sized parking space.<br /> Their maneuvers  including head-on, reverse and parallel parking  were timed and rated for accuracy. Each motorist was also judged by how far the vehicle was kept from the edges of the parking space.<br /> Incredibly, even though the female volunteers were appreciably slower, researchers were nevertheless surprised to discover that the extra time didnt translate into a superior final result.

>       Dr. Claudia Wolf of Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, who led the study, said the research indeed confirmed previous findings. Namely, men have better co-ordination and spatial awareness than women. As well, men are more apt to take risks behind the wheel.

>       These prejudices exist and as a scientist I decided the find out if they are true or based on myth, she recently told the U.K.s<em> Daily Mail</em>. I don't think that feminism or the cause of women is in any way set back by these findings. It only proves what previous studies about the spatial differences between men and women have shown.

>       As well, Dr. Wolf was quick to point out that just because men are inherently better at parking vehicles, this doesnt mean males are the superior gender.

If it's proven by science, it has to be true. Looks like Sarpanch was right all along.
