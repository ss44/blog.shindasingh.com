It would seem that John Oakley decided to chime in on the Bruce Allen commentary fiasco by dropping his own little commentary on the mater. Completely ignoring and neglecting the fact that Allen pretty much did an about turn in his 'apology' saying that his comments were taken out of context and that he was instead defending and standing up for minorities rather then shitting on them. 

All the same, I don't see how taking cheap shots against a community will bring about any positive discussion, especially since all the incidents that he described have been furiously un-condoned by the community at large. So to bring these back up and to hold them against us, is just petty.
