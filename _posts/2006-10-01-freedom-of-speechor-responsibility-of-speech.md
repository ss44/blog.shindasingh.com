Its hard to write a post about the following clip. None the less it was posted on [Singh Sahba Canada's](http://www.singhsabhacanada.com/) website, which seems to be a group&nbsp;which&nbsp;favours and supports the notorious Kalaa Afghanaa, and is a proponent for the Sikh Missionary College.

The following is&nbsp;from a scene that happened last week at Mayfield Gurdwara Sahib, in Brampton Ontario.&nbsp;The speaker is Inder Singh Ghugga, professor of Sikh&nbsp;Missionary College. 

I've never been fan of a missionary college let alone had the stomach to deal with them. Since knowing about them I've just had this natural repulsion&nbsp;against them. This had less to do with there actual vichaar's and more to do with the&nbsp;the arrogance in which they presented themselves when dealing with them in any sort of vichaar. 

At the on-set Singhs made it clear that they did not appreciate Inder Singh Ghugga's views and stances in certain regards. A book he had published challenged different philosophies sensitive to&nbsp;many in the Sikh faith. While some may feel this is in his full freedom of speech / right to present these views, others take it that a certain level of responsibility need be taken by that individual when presenting there views. 

Although, I do agree it would have been better if vichaar was done and a debate within Sangat was arranged versus the protest, it was highly apprehensive that Inder Singh spew such remarks towards the Singhs knowing good well the atmosphere&nbsp;was already as&nbsp;volatile as it was.

At the end of the day I guess it all comes down to..."if you want beef lets get it then...you want peace I'm with it then..I dont start beef I finish it. yea dawg I'm militant"...

_Just to note - Since the incident Singhs have been able to get together, and create a peace, having done Ardaas for forgiveness. It is rumored that several sit downs have also occured between Inder Singh Ghugga and various vidvaans as he mentions, and hopefully the recordings exist somewhere so to be presented on the net at some time._
