Over the past few weeks I've been in various discussions with people over the Israel / Lebanon conflict always trying to see things as objectively as I possibly could, from both sides. In light of all this I can clearly say that I'm behind Hezbollah in this conflict and although it's hard to fathom, can see them coming out of this on top.

Firstly, I'll openly admit that Hezbollah is out gunned and out manned. However, one can never under estimate the power of the guerrilla fighter. Guerrilla's in the context that I speak of them are those individuals fighting in a resistance movement, against an oppressive government. Basically the way I look at it, although maybe naively is that the guerrilla fighter is he who fights for something greater then himself, the underdog going up against the heavy weight champ In that sense, it goes without saying that a guerrilla warrior is by far one of the strongest type of warriors that any foe can go up against on the field. The Sikh jhajaroo's of the 80's and 90's and of today are guerrilla's. The strength of the guerrilla against the forces of the West in this case Israel, was best summed by Malcolm X, in his Ballot of a Bullet speech that he gave, when he described why the _White Man_ (US, British, Euro league) will never win another war when fighting against such guerrilla's,

      Why some rice farmers -- some rice farmers -- some rice eaters ran him out of Korea. Yes, they ran him out of Korea. Rice eaters with nothing but gym shoes and a rifle and a bowl of rice took him and his tanks and his napalm and all that other action he's supposed to have and ran him across the Yalu. Why? 'Cause the day that he can win on the ground has passed.

      Up in French Indo-China those little peasants, rice growers, took on the might of the French army and ran all the Frenchmen -- you remember Dien Bien Phu. No.

      The same thing happened in Algeria, in Africa. They didn't have anything but a rifle. The French had all these highly mechanized instruments of warfare, but they put some guerrilla action on, and a -- and a -- and a white man can't fight a guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla action takes heart, takes nerve, and he doesn't have that. He's brave when he's got tanks. He's brave when he's got planes. He's brave when he's got bombs. He's brave when he got a whole lot of company along with him, but you take that little man from Africa and Asia, turn him loose in the woods with a blade, with a blade -- that's all he needs, all he needs is a blade -- and when the sun comes down -- goes down and it's dark, it's even-steven.

      The greatest asset that a guerrilla has, is the fact that the guerrilla is not fighting someone else's war (again sticking to my definition of a guerrilla). He is not doing a job, which will put food on his table, or completing a duty for which he will get a cheque to help pay his bills. The guerrilla warrior is that person fighting for something larger then himself, an idea which can not die with the death of just one man. It's because of this that the guerrilla fighters always have uprisings. Israel has been fighting Hezbollah since '82, and with each new generation finds itself fighting the same battle over and over again, simply because you can kill the people, but not the idea, and cause that Hezzbollah's fighting for, which the majority of people in Lebanon support, ie. Israel out of Lebanon and release of all political prisoners.

      So, given that Israel may in all likeliness (even though they are getting rocked right now) win this battle, Hezbollah and the people of Lebanon will win the war, and only then will there be the chance for peace.

      <a href="http://thepanthicotpreka.blogspot.com/2006/08/isreal-and-lebanon-conflict.html">Otpreka Singh posted a video on his site</a>, which I'll post below which I feel best justifies Hezbollah's stance against Israel and why I to choose to stand for them in this conflict.
