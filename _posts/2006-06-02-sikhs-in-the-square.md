Its that time of year again ,when every Sikh, Gurdwara Parbhandik, and Jathabandi takes a moment out of their normal routine and spends just that extra time to reflect on 84, the genocide, the fight and the attacks.

In Toronto, I don't know about any big public programs, which is quite sad really, and the onus falls largely on us the youth, considering its now our turn to pick up the slack. Fortunatly not all the Sangat or youth are as lazy as us Torontonians when it comes to raising their voice at this time of year publicly, and it seems like the UK Sangat (yes I realize how hypocritical this post must seem considering [last weeks post](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=216)), have really started something positive. The 84 march/rally is definitely something that would be awesome if we could pull the likes of here in Toronto, but I highly doubt that the number of supporters and Sangat there would ever be replicated.

It would be awesome if we could get even a good 10 000 + people together and march downtown just to bring awareness in the media and the people that Sikhs are still bleeding from the terrorist attacks taken against us, by the Indian government, but just seems like every year less and less is done, which again is our fault.

Anyways for all you UK readers be sure to go out and support the rally, since every head counts, and the more people that walk, the more the community will make its point.
