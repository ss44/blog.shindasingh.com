While realizing that there are way more [important](http://www.panthic.org/news/126/ARTICLE/4184/2008-06-20.html) things going on in the world right now that deserve proper mention, thought and even acknowledgment, I couldn't help but feel a little indulged when I found out that lil ol me was being quoted on a [p2p news site](http://www.p2pnet.net/story/16197) for a snip I scratched out at lunch on a [tech forum](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r20690166-The-Bell-Disclosure~start=40) regarding Bells recent monopolization of DSL Internet in Canada. I wonder if this counts as being 'published'?
