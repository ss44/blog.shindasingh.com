  <strong>With great power, comes great responsibility  Ben Parker</strong>
</div>

As many people know the blog-sphere has erupted with everyone going crazy, and donating there two cents about the whole European, Muslim fiasco, so I thought it was high time I join the debate and offer up my perspective on things.

For those of you who know nothing about what Im talking about, then heres a brief breakdown.

A newspaper in Denmark, printed an editorial cartoon that depicts the Muslim prophet Mohammad, with a bomb in his pugh. Muslims got sick pissed, and went out basically declared a boycott on all Danish goods etc. They also went and kicked out the bureaucrats at the Danish embassies in the Muslim states. In retaliation other European papers printed similar editorial cartoons, protesting free speech etc. and the rest you can figure out on your own. (Or do a Google search on the matter).

Now, a lot of people are screaming that freedom of speech has come under attack with the Muslims basically going all Jihadi against European officials, and are completely out of line. After giving this some thought, I disagree completely.

First and foremost Im all for freedom of speech, dont get me wrong. After all its because of freedom of speech that Im able to say and write the things that I do. At the same time with this power, I also have a responsibility over the things that I say, and am liable for what I say. Basically if I start calling people out, then I do so knowing that I might provoke them to start something. Just like in the good ol Turner days, I wouldnt talk shit about someone and not expect it to escalate into a fight. So unless I was willing to go there I kept my mouth shut.

Same goes for these journalists. Knowing how the Muslim masses are in general, you dont go printing such things without expecting to get some reaction. Ive read many people argue that its all well and dandy, but those cartoons are no cause to take up arms against other individuals and this is my friends is where the great divide is created between the two cultures.

More then anything else rather then seeing it as a whole backwards way of thinking, they should for a second look at it rather as utter and unadulterated love. After all its well known that _men in love do crazy things_ or as Freud put it, _One is very crazy when in love._

Does this mean that those who dont act up in such ways are not devout? Possibly, but I see it more as people being devout to something else. Where as these hard line Muslims are so devout to their ideals that they are willing to kill and die for them, I see many of us in the West have now adopted an opposite attitude that, going to any extreme is wrong and we should really be balanced and impartial. Basically we remove ourselves as far as we can from everything and anything and no longer dedicating ourselves to any one ideal.

While some may see this as a positive and step forward I really see it as a step backward. After all if Sir William Wallace removed himself from his ideals would he have been who he was and accomplished what he did? Would Che Guevara be honored if he compromised his ideals and beliefs? Would Sant Jarnail Singh be looked at as being the greatest Sikh of the 21st centaury if they were wishy washy about their ideals and beliefs?

Now, I disagree with the ideals and beliefs held by hard lining Muslims, but Ill never disagree with the passion and fervor that they support and hold them in.

After all if youre not willing to die for your beliefs or let alone live to uphold them, then do you really believe in all that you say you do? I would think not.

And off course when such things happen Im forced to look at how we as Sikhs would react in a similar situation. I think its pretty safe to say that for the most part the masses would be appalled but would rather not take any drastic action. Wed send out petitions maybe even hold a protest on some day, then after feel that weve made our voice heard and everyone goes back on with their business.

Now this can be looked as both a good or bad thing. If we reacted in the above manor it would no doubt make us look mature and intelligent, but at the same time it would make us look weak and backbone less, after all we just got slapped and all we did was say, hey dont do that, rather then as the Muslims are doing now, giving a push back and warning others not to try that again.

I would much prefer the second image, of the dude who doesnt start fights but you not wanting to push him, out of fear of him pushing you right back, rather then being the guy who you can push and only have him raise his voice to you with a slim possibility of him snapping.

After all, _were no killers but dont push us._
