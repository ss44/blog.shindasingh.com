Everyones done it, procrastinated to the point where you only have 10 minutes left before a final and all of a sudden you realize, that you just dont got a chance, so now you got two options you can either, run a scam (defer, cheat, whatever) OR you can fail in style.

Running scams is all fun but sooner or later it catch's up with you and you just get to the point where it doesn't seem like its worth your while. These days I feel as though I'm just too old and can't be bothered with the acting, and thinking involved in preparing a scam so I opt for option #2, (the lazy mans option no doubt), failing in style.

Now various ideas come to mind, you can walk in and walk out Walk in scream at the prof and walk out. You could just not show. The ideas are plenty, but all lack the creativity that would make them relevant and memorable, after all how many of us havent already seen someone air out a prof or teacher before.

So as I sit in here 10 minutes before my final exam I turn to YouTube to show me how its done. Although incredibly stupid this fool ranks high almost a prefect score when it comes to creativity. I figure if your going to fail theres no better way to do it, other then to do it like this fool. (Note: Although creative personally this would just be embarrassing for me to do.)



I doubt I'd ever able to run that, and get applause or laughs. If anything the auditorium would clear out with screams of terror, thinking I'm some next suicide bomber. (Reminds me of the time in Cinci @ Lord of the Rings ;))Anyways got too think positive thoughts, I wonder whos going to get fired tonight on Apprentice?..Chuloo time to bounce..
