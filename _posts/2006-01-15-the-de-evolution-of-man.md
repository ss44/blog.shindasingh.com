We hear it all the time, about how far evolved man has become. We are stronger, faster and live longer then we did 20 years ago, but at the same time all these things are no longer things the average person needs. These days everything and anything can be accomplished simply by pressing buttons.

I actually think we have gone backwards as a race rather then forward, and we see it reflected in our youth all the time, with headlines talking about the obesity, the lack of fresh air, etc. These days the average person is so un-fit and unhealthy that we really couldn't do much if in fact we ever did need to take up arms.

As kids most of us, well at least those people I grew up with and still know, we where always active. From day break to sunset we would be outside doing something. Personally one of my favourite things was going to the park and playing around on the equipment, which leads me the point of all this jabbering.

I think as adults or at least as young adults we need adult parks. Parks where the equipment is sized in proportion to us. An outdoor playground resembling the activities seen on Survivior, or American Gladiator. But then then again we can always make the world we live in, our playground. A trend which has been catching on in Europe, known as [Parkour AKA Free Running](http://www.parkour.com/), does just that. You basically turn yourself into Spiderman or any other agile superhero you can think off and just race, paying no heed to the obstacles in your way.

I'm pretty sure 100 years ago most youth would be active enough to participate in this type of thing, but these days skills such as these are left for the select few. Anyways check out the following video as it really highlights the whole concept of free running, and may also remind many of you of your younger days as monkeys.
