With the leaves changingÂ  colour, the weather turning colder and the days getting shorter, its that time of year to take a moment and stop to reflect once again with what happened in 1984. While different area's will all have there own programs to commemorate the riots, for those in the GTA be sure to check out the event at the _new_ Chandhni Convention Center, on November 15th.
