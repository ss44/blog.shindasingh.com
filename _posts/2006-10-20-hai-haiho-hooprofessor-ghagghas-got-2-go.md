Keeping upto date with what seems to be everyone's favourite topic and one that is starting to get old really fast, is that it seem's like Ghagga is back in the news and this time it's over a conference that is taking place this weekend.

The video released on panthic weekly helped those unfamiliar with Ghagga get an idea of who he is, and what he stands for. Although in those videos Ghagga does come to make some concessions, he has on other fronts apparently remained defiant and rumored to have asked for a re-match of sorts.

All that aside a well known and respected Sikh scholar from India, [Professor Harpal Singh Pannu](http://www.universitypunjabi.org/pages/teaching/biodata/religious_studies/H_s_pannu.htm), professor of world religions specializing in religious philosophy and comparative religions and someone who seems to be familiar with Ghagga and the Kalaa Afghanaa Missionary Camp, has also weighed into the on going discussion by offering his own veechars on a local Radio program the other day.

As far the interview went I was left pretty impressed by the Prof's veechars and general soch on Sikhi and his take on Ghagga's writings. I guess it was refreshing at the very least.

Anyway's getting back to the topic of the seminar at which Ghagga will be speaking. I received an email about a **<font size="4" color="#ff0000"><u>PEACEFUL</u></font>** protest that will be taking place.

## **Peaceful protest by Saadh Sangat**

It is with folded hands that we request your presence on Sunday, October 22<sup>nd</sup> at Premier Banquet Hall, 2360 Lucknow Drive, Brampton, at 11am-3pm for a collective boycott of the scheduled seminar being held by Inder Singh Ghugga and participation in a peaceful protest. Inder Singh Ghugga is an avid supporter of the notorious panthic enemy known as Kala Afgana who has been excommunicated by the Akhaal Takhat for his anti-Sikhi activities. His presence in Toronto, Ontario of the last few weeks has left a bad taste in the mouths of many Sikhs in the Greater Toronto Area and worldwide as well. He is known to ferociously attack and manipulate basic Sikhi principles. Below are just a few of his many extensive attacks on the Panth.

  1. Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji was pressured by Muslims when travelling to Mecca and voluntarily consumed Halal meat. When asked about evidence supporting this, Ghugga replied that this was a part of his imagination.
  2. During the martyrdom of Guru Arjun Dev Ji, he was unable to retain consciousness during the torture and therefore became unconscious. These words indicate his desire to portray Guru Sahib as an ordinary human being. When challenged in regards to this, he was once again quick to admit it was a figment of his imagination
  3. The usage of words such as "Badmaash" and derogatory slurs in reference to Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
  4. In his own literature he has deemed the very pillar of Sikhi, Naam Simran as unnecessary along with Mool Mantar and Gurmantar.
  5. The importance and power of Naam Simran which is stressed within each word of Gurbani is completely dismissed by Ghugga in his literature
  6. Even the importance of Ardaas is undermined within writings by Ghugga
  7. Publicly challenges the authenticity of Banis contained in the morning Nitnem such as Jaap Sahib and Chaupayee Sahib, whereby undermining the entire Amrit Sanchar ceremony.
  8. The core fundamentals of Sikhi and those who lived by the word of the Guru have been attacked shamelessly by Ghugga
  9. Being oblivious to the correct pronunciation and lacking grammatical knowledge of Gurbani, Ghugga fails to recognize the importance of vowels when translating Gurbani.

In addition to the concerns raised above, there are many other discrepancies and anti-Gurmat statements contained within literature published by Ghugga, some of which we hope to highlight in the coming days. It should be noted that it is his anti-panthic actions that have resulted in him not being allotted time to speak at any Gurdwara.

Busses will be leaving from Spingdale, Rexdale Gurdwara Sahib, Dixie Gurdwara Sahib at 10 AM..
