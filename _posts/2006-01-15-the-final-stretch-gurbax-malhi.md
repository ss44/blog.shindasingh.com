With less then a week left, and with advance polls happening in the election, I thought it would be a good time, to write a follow up post to the [previous one](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/2005/12/political-mess.html).

The polls are all pointing towards a conservative majority, but the polls are changing so much you never know what to expect come election day.

Gurbax Malhi
  
Malhi, is the first Desi MP to accomplish what politicians strive for, and that's to become an iconic figure in their riding.

[<img border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Malhi_Gurbax-762085.gif" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/Malhi_Gurbax-764483.gif)First elected in 1993 when the Liberals first took office, Malhi gained notice because of his bright red Turban. 13 years later, poor English and all, he's still around representing Malton.

Last term, Malhi was infamous for bringing up Gay Marriage wherever he went, speaking out against it, and getting other Liberal MP's into trouble (Bains & Dhalla), but yet always stood his ground. Considering most desi's in the riding owe Malhi, for a support letter or two, I don't see him going anywhere any time soon.

As most people, I've always had a love-hate relationship with Malhi. When he fist got elected, Malhi was awesome, first MP in parliament with a dastar and all. 8 Years later, I was wondering how he was still in office, and how come no one was able to knock him out. Hated the fact that I had to hear him speak wherever I went. Morning wedding, he was there giving a speech. The night reception he was there giving a speech. Visakhi, he was there giving a speech. Any random day at the Gurdwara, he was there giving a speech. Now, after all the shit he's disturbed, and trouble he's caused for the other MP's how can you not like him.

Shinda's prediction - Malhi wins by a land slide.
