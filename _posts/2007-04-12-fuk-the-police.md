> 
> On Friday March 30, 2007 at around 3:00pm, Mr. Kuldip Singh Nag, a Sikh American who was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in the U.S. Navy during the first Gulf War, was at his home in Joliet, IL when a local police officer noticed that a van parked on Mr. Nag’s private property had expired registration tags. Upon being confronted with this, Mr. Nag’s wife, Vera Kaur Nag, informed the officer that the van is parked on their driveway and was inoperable. 
> 
> Mr. Nag then came outside to answer the officer’s questions regarding the van. The Joliet police officer then demanded that Mr. Nag park the van inside his garage and not on the driveway, to which Mr. Nag responded to the officer that it was not possible and that regardless, the van is parked on his private property and he has a right to park it on his driveway. 
> 
> At this moment, the officer pulled out his pepper spray and attacked Mr. Nag. As Mr. Nag screamed in agony, the officer removed his baton and violently struck Mr. Nag numerous times until he fell to the ground. While the assault ensued, the officer was reported by both Mr. and Mrs. Nag as saying, “You f\***\*\\*\* Arab! You f\*\*\*\\*\* immigrant, go back to you f\*\*\**** country before I kill you!”. 
> 
> Mr. Nag’s wife and six year-old child both witnessed the violent assault, which resulted in Mr. Nag immediately being admitted to the hospital where he stayed for five days due to complaints of intense pain and head trauma. Mr. Nag also received numerous bruises and a serious head injury which have caused him to go blind for several minutes at a time. 
> 
> “This case seems to be a clear incident of police misconduct in Illinois,” said SALDEF Managing Director Kavneet Singh. “We are horrified at the anti-immigrant sentiment the officer allegedly used as he violently accosted Mr. Nag, and further that his six year old son was a witness to this violent assault. We call upon both Joliet and Illinois officials to investigate this incident and for the Illinois community to stand in solidarity with Mr. Nag. 
> 
> SALDEF has garnered the strong support of the Illinois Sikh American community and is currently working with The Chawla Group Ltd to represent Mr. Nag in a criminal case brought on by the City of Joliet.</blockquote>

> When Rodney King, a black man from LA, was pulled over and beaten by the cops his story sparked mass race riots in Los Angeles. A similar story happened back 2001 in Cincinnati when Steven Roach was aquited of murdering an unarmed black youth. So then today I hear the story about Kuldip Nag, a desi , US Gulf War Veteran who gets his ass beaten by a cop over expired plates on a van that was broken and sitting in his driveway and there’s still little thought or even threat of shit hitting the fan. 
> 
> Naturally this leads me to wonder if we as a community are we waiting for more stupidness to go down before we see the Jessie Jacksons of our community (whoever they maybe) get out in the media and start blasting the police and getting the community all roweled up to take action. 
> 
> Sadly enough, most uncles we see are more then complacent when it comes to this type of news and would rather try to lead the community in the direction of least resistance and confrontation, with the mentality that hey we’ll make life easier for them now then maybe master will help us out a bit later on, when we need to get that visa or those immigration papers signed. 
> 
> See I agree screaming and looting and parading down the downtown cores won’t do anything for us other then get us labeled as savages, but some sort of outrage on a communal level should be expected and delivered. See maybe its complete over reaction on my part to expect such things, after all compared to India, the number of us getting beat for random shit by cops is still relatively minimal, but when do we take a beating as more then a beating? Unless we let people know that we’re not down for getting our asses beat and labeled Arabs I just don’t see this type of shit ending any time soon. 
> 
> See I’m not trying to say that what Saldef, and the Sikh Coalition are doing isn’t enough, I’m more interested in how long it will be before the rest of us and the broader community takes notice of such things and starts letting our voices be heard.
