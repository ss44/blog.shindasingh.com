The Sikh Quam is no stranger to snitchs. Be it from the lying snitch who was Prithi Chand, to Indira Gandhis great relative Gangu Bhramin, weve had our share of those who profited by trying to trip us up.

Why snitch? Why lie? Why any of it? Ive personally never had a place in my heart for snitches. This goes back to when I was young and someone told the teachers about a fight, or when I saw other students baiting out others for cheating. Now dont get things twisted. Im not saying we should turn a blind eye, or let crooks get away with crimes. Im more talking about when people interfere and twist things for their own profit, or bring others down in spite and revenge. i.e start witch hunts against their enemies by pointing at others and shouting WITCH, getting all the villagers to arm themselves with pitch forks and head off to crucify that person.

[<img width="143" height="152" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/beant5-782685.jpg" />](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/uploaded_images/beant5-792079.jpg)In India, though people dont point and say witch, if you got a long dhari and keep Guru Sahibs roop, you can be sure that if you annoy the wrong people, you can get a knock on your door in the middle of the night ready to take you away, after all you just ended up fitting the description for Indias most wanted.

Many people disappeared in such ways, never to be seen or heard of again. Many probably even profited from such crimes. There are stories about how owners of photo stores in India used to report Singhs, when they got photos developed. You know the photos Im talking about, the ones that are hung up around the Gurdwaras and now adorned on the many 84 tribute sites.

But even then, that type of snitching I guess should come to be expected, after all why would the enemy be on your side? Unless of course the enemy spends all day smiling at you, telling you that youre family, but for trusting such people who can be blamed for such naivety but us. After all its not their fault we are / were naïve. So its not these snitches that I really care about or that get on my nerves. Instead its the ones who are supposed to be your brothers, the uncle toms with vengeance.

I wouldnt be surprised if a majority of those that were turned into the police in the 80s were done so via _anonymous_ tips, from their so called brethren. Now its these rats which annoy the @$## out of me. Now I can **_try_** to understand the reasons why they would sell their own out, but for a couple of dollars and even a semi lofty lifestyle it just doesnt seem worth it. Then again greed and ambition will make people to crazy things.

I guess that only goes to brighten gems such as Bhai Taroo Singh. Who when asked by the Mughals as to where the Singhs were laying, they gave them the cold shoulder. Then when a knife was put to his throat, still smiled back and said _nopes._ The Mughals thinking they where clever said fine well take your kes, and instead of snitching, Bhai Taroo Singh gave them his scalp. Bhai Mani Singh another rare diamond, was asked to sell out Sangat or be cut piece by piece, told the Mughals not to miss a joint and even helped show them where to start.

Talking about loyalty, is talking about our history about our past and about us. How can a Sikh who snitches and lies even consider him or herself a Sikh? How do they even coexist with the likes of these and other Sikhs in history who we can list till we go blue in the face. Snitching is like the unwritten kurait within Sikhi. As Sikhs, we dont drink, we dont smoke, we dont cut our kes and we definitely dont snitch.</p>

So why this long rambling on snitches? Because as much as we like to think that the morcha of the 80s is over, it hasnt even started. Paniarawalaa is still roaming around free, so is Ashotoush, while Singhs such as Jagtar Singh Harwara, are behind bars, thanks to those anonymous tips, and hes not the only one, just one of the more publicized. There have been countless Singhs who in an effort to stop such mentioned villains found themselves behind bars, even before they left home. Singhs whose only wish was to do what the police and government seem to have little or no care for, justice.

Keep your mouths shut. After all, youre selling out more then your brother, youre selling out your faith, and your commitment to it. Fine disagree, but dont go sending your brothers to jail, just because they against you for being _jatehdaar_, (ahem Dhumma), or so you can make a quick buck out of it (yall know who you are). So if, and when the GOI come-a-knocking and you dont want to risk babbling like a brook, or singing like a canary, stitch em up shut.
