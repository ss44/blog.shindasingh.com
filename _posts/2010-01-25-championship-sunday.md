    Football Sunday did not disappoint yesterday. For the first time in almost two decades the two best teams in the NFL will meet in the Superbowl and rightly so. The Colts did what they do best - throw the ball - and took over the game in the second half. Payton Manning proved once again that he is not only the best QB in the NFL but in my eyes, the best QB of all-time. Rex Ryan and the Jets need to conform to the new NFL and get a better passing game in the off-season if the Sanchize wants another run the playoffs next year.

    The late game was easily one of the best games all year long. Well, at least it was for Saints and casual fans. As for the the Viking and Brett Favre fans, not so much. Favre proved once again that when he has to throw the ball more than he should, he will mess up. The law of averages always catches up to everybody.

    I still don't get why in your right mind are you throwing the ball on 3rd down with 18seconds left in the game. Stupid decision by the coach and a stupider decision by the QB. Do what you been doing all year and just check the ball off to someone nearby and kick your FG. But it wasn't meant to be. In the end the better team won.

    This setups what could be the most entertaining Superbowl ever. Two teams that love to pass the ball and can score in bunches. The top two QBs in the game this year going to head to head. But that's a conversation for another day. For now, let's enjoy in the glory of the Colts dominating, Saints winning and Brett Favre giving away another game.

    Oh and one more thing from yesterday. The RAPTORS beat the Lakers! As bad as people say the Raptors are, we now have victories over some of the best teams in the league from LA, Dallas, San Antonio, Orlando and Cleveland. Biggups to Turk, for at least game, for coming thru in the clutch.
