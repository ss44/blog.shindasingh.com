I was asked to give my take on Tiger Woods press conference so here it is.

Tiger Woods is a dumbass and he became a bigger dumbass after that speech he made. And lets be real here, that was no apology. That was one man reading a piece of paper without any emotion and in the middle of it of all, like all disgraced athletes, hes going to find religion now.

Also, apparently his mistresses were pissed off because he didnt apologize to them in his speech. They felt they were owed one. Really? Are you kidding me? You knew who he was. It wasnt as if any of these girls didnt know who they were sleeping with. Hes Tiger god damn Woods. The entire world knows this man and you CHOSE to get into it with him. And then you want an apology? Woman, dont be asking no dumb questions. Tiger Woods aint never had no pumpkin pie. Just because the world knows youre a whore now doesnt mean Tiger owes you an apology.

For the record, let me state I dont agree with what Tiger did to these women. Im just saying they were stupid to get into any sort of a relationship with him. There was no shortage of stupidity on Tigers side either. Come on man, youre a billionaire. Youve created this rep by being private your entire life and you chose to get married and have kids. Dont be acting like a dumbass. Man up son.
