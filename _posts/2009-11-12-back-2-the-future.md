There's a saying in politics particularly that, "the new rat pack administration is no different then the last rat pack administration", and so has been the case with Gurdwara committee's for the last 'X' many years. While each committee bickers and boasts about how they're different, the truth remains that eventually they all end up being roughly the same. It wasn't always the case, considering that there was a time when those involved in the Gurudwaray saw these houses of God, as a means to bring about some sort of social reform. Both a political and spiritual hub that when channeled would bring about a means of uprising and general cohesiveness that lead and united the community, not divide it.

When the current generation, (the one that's currently running things), came of age in the late 70's early 80's everyone was a buzz with revolution. With everything that was going on in India it was only natural that some of the fiver spread to  the West. Wanting to come together as a community and create something monumental, to not only preach but to teach and connect was on everyones agenda. The goals were clear, the objectives known, and with everything that was at stake everyone worked towards achieving the tasks at hand. Unfortunately as the years wore on, optimism was replaced with bitterness. The finger pointing whenever accountability was brought up increased as did the confusion and apathy within the community. All of which would lead to our current state, not of hate or disgust, but indifference.

Indifference to not only what goes on, but indifference to who's doing it. We went from wanting to change the world, to merely just existing in it. We changed our focus from how we could better ourselves and improve our lives through Sikhi to instead bickering about who's sitting on the floor and who's sitting on a table. From whats being sung to who and how someone's singing it. We went from challenging society and unjust laws, to challenging each other on the authenticity of our members lists. Somewhere down the line our leaders instead of showing us and inspiring us, as to what was possible, lost their own focus leading the flock they were in- trusted with astray.

While not singling out or  making references to any particular case or management, it remains that this scenario is but all too common and can apply to just about anywhere. If the problem really is as simple as having just lost ambition, and having set our sights too low, then maybe instead of just doing a tune up we go and opt for a full out repair. Reset our thinking to not hope for what we wanted, but instead wanting even more. Being optimistically brave in feeling that even if we don't change everything we'd have still changed enough. That even if we don't fix all our problems we at least do enough to show that all our problems can be fixed. That even if we don't kill [Xerxies, we at very least throw the spear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-6M5FukAoE) that shows he's mortal.

In the West it seems that the various [youth slate's](http://newfuture.ca/) are the collective driving inspiration of such ideals and optimism for change. Hopefully in the East we'll see something similar, maybe we already are with some of the [new initiatives taking root](http://sikhsservingcanada.blogspot.com/), by the various groups who are beginning to take lead. Then again, we'll have to wait for what tomorrow writes about today, to know for sure. But for now the least we can do is set our sights in the proper direction, show up and make our voices count.
