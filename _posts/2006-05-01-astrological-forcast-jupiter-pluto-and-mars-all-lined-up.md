Yesterday, (Sunday), all the planets must have been lined up, considering all the upsets that happened yesterday.

Sacremento beats San Antonio,
  
Washington beats Cleveland,
  
Lakers beat Suns,
  
Chicago beats Miami???

Sure its not the first time that any of these teams have one or beaten the other, but what are the chances of all these teams winning on the same night??

Oh yea not to mention that TO Khalsa also won there first game beating the 2nd seed in the Malton intrumural league. Talk about weird. Who know's maybe this is a sign that everyone should go out and put all there life savings into buying Nortel Stocks, after all apparently what goes down must go up, at least that was the case yesterday, then just maybe....
