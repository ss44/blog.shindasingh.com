The final installment in our playoff round-up, has Miami pitted against Dallas.

Firstly, that last round was amazing. Miami clobbered Detroit, although Detroit put up a fight, the Justice League prevailed, with The Glove coming up big, and playing once again like he was in his old Seattle Supersonics jersey. Shaq, anyone else catch the block on him? I've never seen someone push Shaq to the floor like Big Ben did, but eh, even Superman falls.

As for the Phoenix, Dallas series, yea I dropped the ball on this one, but then again like readers commented in the past, I went with what I wanted rather then what would. Although Phoenix slugged it out for as long and as hard as they could, end of the day the current Suns team just isn't up to par. They were able to out-run the Lakers, and the Clippers, but Dallas was on pace with them when it came to playing Phoenix ball, and were able slow things down just a notch by playing there lock down defense. I don't think there was a doubt in anyone's mind that this Dallas team wasn't playoff bound, but when you got a team like the Suns who in every matchup were the underdogs, you just can't help but to love them..

With that said lets look at how everyone else did..

Harsimran - 1/2 + 1
  
Tejdeep - 2/2
  
Gagan - 2/2
  
Mandeep - 1/2 + 1
  
Heera - 1/2 + 1
  
Columbus - 2/2 + 1
  
Gurjet - 2/2 + 2
  
D.Singh - 1/2 + 1
  
Jason - 1/2
  
Cincinnati - 1/2
  
Kamaldeep - 1/2
  
Myself - 1/2 + 1

So winner of that round was Gurjeet, but then again anything less would be disappointing.

As for the finals match up, this is definitely a tough one, and will be a fun one to watch.

Dallas has the run gun game of Phoenix, and the stellar defense of the Pistons. All in all they are the team to beat in this one. Miami and the justice league have been playing like crap, the whole playoffs. Shaq is playing like an uninspired third wheel, although his comments are still at par. Wade is looking tired, but then again he's going into this series well rested. Payton, is playing like he was 10 years younger and in many ways put the team on his back. Truthfully I'd call Dallas to beat Miami in 6, but due to my long standing relationship with my brotha from anotha motha, I'm (out of fear of being smacked and not invited to watch the games) go with the Heat. Clearly they're the underdogs here, but Paytons been playing with heart, after all this is his last chance at getting the championship. This is clearly Shaq's last chance to prove that he's a champion with and without Kobe, and as far as Wade, if he's ever going to win a championship then its now. So **Miami in 7.**

Now 'yall know the drill, so get to it..
