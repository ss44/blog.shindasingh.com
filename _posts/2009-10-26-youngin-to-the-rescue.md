Consider the following hypothetical situation:

You're a passengar in a car driven by one of your loved ones and you're on the QEW and your driver suddenly loses consciousness. What do you do? Do you scream like a little girl? Do you take control over the car? Do you jump out and pray that you survive? Do you call for help? A million things must run through your mind when you're trying to make a decision and now imagine your only 9 years old. Because that's exactly what happened to a 9year old boy who was driving with his mother. Check it out:

<span>I gotta give it up to that kid. He doesn't even know how to drive a car yet and yet he was able to save not only himself but also his mother. Hopefully his mother was ok after the medical crisis.<br /> </span>
