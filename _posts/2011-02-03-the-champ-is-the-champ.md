With the impending monster fight between Vitor Belfort and Silva many are throwing weight behind the phenom, but who y'all kidding? Vitor has much a chance of winning this fight as would a one legged chimp in a spelling bee.

  1. Ring rust is real. In the last few years only three fighters have come back from long layoffs. Thanks to the work of someone, [here's a compilation of fighters](http://forums.mmajunkie.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=23665&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a) and how they faired against ring rust. Assuming that the research is all on the up and up (feel free to prove it wrong), I can't imagine Vitor being the exception to this.
  2. Vitors style compliments Sivla's. Silva's a counter striker, his most difficult fights have been wrestlers, not another striker, this is the type of fight that will make Anderson shine. Sure it'll be fun watching someone try and press Silva, for the first few minutes, but once Silva has Vitor's timing down a KO is inevitable.
  3. Inconsistency has been Vitors nickname. Which Vitor is going to show up? This is the biggest fight he's been in, in a long time so does he rise to it? Beflort fans all hope so, but when you've been as inconsistent as he has do you really put your eggs in his basket?

I get the allure for wanting to go with Belfort. His humility and humbleness seem genuine compared to the Silva of late, but hating on Silva is the equivalent of hating on Kobe, the only reason you do it, is because they're just that damn good, and they know it.

Its funny writing this now, since I've always supported Belfort in the past, and was asking for this fight two years ago, but it was never because I thought Beflort would give Silva the most trouble. Rather it was to watch Silva do what he does best and just meticulously dismantle his opponents, one precision elbow/knee/jab at a time.
