I would have shared my brackets, but then again I don't follow NCAA close enough to have made them, but with the Final 4 around I've been able to watch my share of games to make my final four picks. (Share yours and lets see how you do).

  1. Mason Vs Florida - Mason. Defensive stops equals more offensive oppertunities = more pts = win. Even though Florida is probably the better team, I'll still put my faith in the underdogs.
  2. UCLA Vs LSU - LSU beats Texas the team I had down for winning it all, so lets not let Texas's loss be in vain.

To win it all, I'm saying LSU. After all Big Baby Davis, a center who can shoot 3's. What more could you ever ask for??
