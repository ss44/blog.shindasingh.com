A while back Sikhs secured the [right to wear Kirpaans in school](http://www.shindasingh.com/blog/?p=95), thanks to Gurbaaj Singh taking the case to the Supreme Court. However the verdict that allowed us to wear our Kirpaans wasn't all that concise, and left plenty of room for individual school boards to decide on the particulars.

Any time the Kirpaan and its "dangerous" side effects ever enters any type of discussion, Sikhs are quick to jump up and shout that the Kirpaan has never been used to harm any individual or in any criminal activity. Although a bold statement to make, most individuals are hard pressed to find a case involving the violent use of a Kirpaan. With that said though, its articles like the following that really hit a nerve especially considering we've barley earned the right to wear a Kirpaan and all of a sudden you got dumb shits like this pulling them out and using them in fights and even worse getting booked. Listen we all do stupid things growing up, and even so at that age and in Brampton fights are common place, but if your going to go do something stupid at least don't get booked doing it, ruining it for the rest of us.

Here's the Brampton Guardian article, if you know more about this in detail and if you notice that Guardian article is exaggerating or missing certain pieces then share them, but left inciting rumors by naming names and getting the Police asking me for ip's, after all this ain't crime stoppers.

> **Student attacked with sword**
> 
> A 15-year-old Brampton Centennial Secondary School student is lucky to be alive after a sword attack on school grounds Monday.
> 
> Another 16-year-old student is under arrest and facing several assault and weapons charges. According to Peel Regional Police, the two teenagers were involved in an argument in front of the McMurchy Avenue school around the noon hour. The dispute escalated into a physical altercation and the older teen pulled out a metre-long sword police believe he had tucked in his pants.
> 
> The younger teen was struck with the weapon several times on the head, arm and back, police said. He received deep lacerations to his head, arms and legs that required more than 50 staples and stitches to close, according to police at the scene.
> 
> His wounds were not life threatening and the 15-year-old was treated and released from Brampton hospital.
> 
> Swift intervention by school staff to stop the fight and contact police may have saved his life.
> 
> A spokesperson for Peel police said it was unclear what started the argument or fueled the violent attack.
> 
> Brian Woodland, a spokesperson for the Peel District School Board, said privacy laws prevent him from speaking about the specific students involved. However, he did note bringing a weapon onto school property and assaulting someone is cause for immediate disciplinary action by the school and school board.
> 
> "Our normal process would be to suspend (the student) for the 20 day maximum," said Woodland. During that period the school and board would also begin the expulsion process, he added.
> 
> In a letter sent home to parents, the school's principal explained the incident and commended staff and students for their actions during the crisis. He assured parents the school remains a safe learning environment and asked anyone with information to contact police. "This (kind of incident) is extraordinarily rare," Woodland said.
> 
> The 16-year-old has been charged with aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, possession of a weapon dangerous to the public and carrying a concealed weapon.
> 
> He is being held in custody until a bail hearing scheduled for June 2. The teenager cannot be identified under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
> 
> The investigation is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to contact 22 Division Criminal Investigation Bureau at 905-453-2121, ext. 2233 or Peel Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS(8477).
