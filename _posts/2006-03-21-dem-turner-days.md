An unknown weapon...extreme head injuries??? My money is on it being a karrDa, after all saw nuff men break heads wid dem tings. But then again I could be wrong, considering most people saw a tire iron being used. The [Brampton Guardian article](http://www.northpeel.com/br/news/story/3393917p-3925376c.html),

> **Police search for attackers**
> 
> A 16-year-old Turner Fenton Secondary School student is in stable condition after he was severely beaten and hit over the head, possibly with a tire iron, in a parking lot in the area of Steeles Avenue East and Kennedy Road.
> 
> The teen was beaten by five to six other teens in front of a crowd of witnesses, according to police. He suffered head injuries, including a fractured skull, and was unconscious when police arrived just after 3 p.m. Monday. He was taken to Peel Memorial Hospital, then transferred to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. His condition improved overnight and he was upgraded to stable from critical. He is expected to survive and recover from his injuries, according to police.
> 
> Police are interviewing several witnesses, but are asking for anyone in the area to call if they have any information. Police say witnesses have told them the weapon used to hit the boy looked like a tire iron. It has not been recovered. The attack happened in a parking lot just south of the Sears Home Store and just north of Turner Fenton Secondary School, but not on school property. It is not known if the attackers are students at the school, or if the victim knows his attackers.

> High school students from Turner Fenton often congregate in the west end of the parking lot, part of the Orion Gate plaza. Investigators are searching for five or six South Asian youth between 16 and 18 years.
