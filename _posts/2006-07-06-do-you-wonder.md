Come to Wonderland with your friends [Gurpreet](http://gurpzsingh.blogspot.com/) and me, on Wednesday the 12th (2 days after osy and 3 days before COSS) and quit with all the wondering. Come Wednesday, meet at the park, heck dont meet at the park go in little groups, we dont really care, show up or don't, no need to tell us in advance. It's your life, your money and your time. Yall know what to do and where 2 go, and if you dont, call a cab...or stay home...we are looking into a live broadcast...stay tune.Holla atcha ya bois!!

  <span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.9em"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 0.9em">No members of COSS or OSY were consulted in anyway prior to this posting. If you don't see me or Gurpreet at the park, take it as a sign that I didn't bother taking the day from work and that Gurpreet didn't bother skipping school. If you feel insulted, offended and or betrayed by this poster, then your better of wondering about the things above since the chances of you getting an apology are slim. If you feel that this post is a mockery of everything you stand for, then go stand for something else. If you feel, left it like we really care how you (Gurpreet has not been consulted) feel.</span></span>
