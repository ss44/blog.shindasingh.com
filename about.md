10+ years later and this blog is still kicking around. Often time's suriving barley on life support. 

Once every few months though I'll devise a new strategy consisting of blogging more regularly, but seldom do I come around. All the same it's good to have this space ready and available in the event that I do have an idea which I think is worth sharing with the world.

'Till then keep checking back at your own risk. Chances of updates are slim.
